<h2 class="p4">PREFACE.</h2>

<p class="pline ">-</p>

<p class="drop-cap04 p2">DURING my residence in Brazil, I had no intention
of publishing any account of what I had seen and
heard in that country. Some time after my return to
England, I was encouraged to put together the information
which I might be able to impart. The reader will
be more disposed to excuse what defects he may find,
when he is informed that I went out young, that I did not
gather any knowledge of the country in a systematic
manner with the idea of giving it to the public, and that
the idiom of a foreign language is perhaps more familiar
to me than that of my own. But among judicious
readers the style of works of this description will be regarded
as of little importance. I have had the advantage
of Mr Southey’s advice and extensive library. I have
to thank Dr. Traill for his aid in preparing the Appendix;
though as he did not see the whole of it, if there
are any errors they must be attributed to me, not to
him. The drawings for the plates were executed by a
near relative, from very rough sketches of my own, assisted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
by description. The outline of the map is taken
from Mr. Arrowsmith’s large map of South America;
and the names and situations of some places are corrected,
and others are inserted from my own knowledge.
The plan of the harbour of Pernambuco was furnished
to me by an English gentleman resident at Recife, who is
indefatigable in the search of whatever may contribute to
the increase of knowledge.</p>

<h2 class="p2">CHAPTER I.</h2>

<p class="pch">DEPARTURE FROM LIVERPOOL.&mdash;ARRIVAL AT PERNAMBUCO.&mdash;THE TOWN AND
HARBOUR OF RECIFE.&mdash;THE GOVERNOR.&mdash;THE TRADE.</p>


<p class="drop-cap03">IF my health had not required a change of climate, I should not
perhaps so soon have accomplished the wish I had often expressed
of leaving England for a short time. An immediate removal
was judged expedient; and as the ports of Spain and Portugal were
either closed to British subjects, or at least not in a state to be
visited by an invalid, I determined upon Brazil; to which my friends
agreed.&mdash;I fixed upon Pernambuco, because a gentleman, who had
for many years been acquainted with my family, was about to embark
for that place, and from the favourable reports of the people and
climate which I had received from several persons. On the 2d November
1809, I set sail from Liverpool in the ship Lucy.</p>

<p>We had a very prosperous passage of thirty-five days, without any
occurrence worthy of particular notice.</p>

<p>I was agreeably awakened very early on the morning of the 7th
December, with the news that we were in sight of land, and
likely to get into harbour this day. We soon discovered two vessels,
with all sail set, making for us; these proved to be two English
merchant-ships, bound likewise to Pernambuco; they had never
before been at this port, and therefore wished to receive some information
respecting it; they judged that, from the manner in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
which our vessel made for the land, her commander must be acquainted
with it, which was the case, this being the second voyage
of the Lucy to Pernambuco.</p>

<p>The land is low, and consequently not to be seen at any considerable
distance; but as we approached it, we distinguished the
hill upon which stands the city of Olinda, a little to the northward;
and some leagues to the southward, the Cape of St. Agostinho; a
nearer view discovered to us the town of St. Antonio do Recife,
almost a-head with the shipping in front of it; the dreary land
between it and Olinda, which is one league distant, and coco<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
groves northward, as far as the eye can reach; southward of the
town are also seen great numbers of coco trees, woods, and scattered
cottages. The situation of Olinda is the highest in the neighbourhood;
and though not very high, is still not despicable. Its
appearance from the sea is most delightful; its white-washed
churches and convents upon the tops and sides of the hill; its
gardens and trees, interspersed amongst the houses, afford a promise
of great extent, and hold out expectations of great beauty. The
sands, which extend one league to the southward of it, are relieved by
two fortresses erected upon them, and by the ships in the lower
harbour. Then follows the town of Recife, with the appearance
of being built in the water, so low is the sand-bank upon which it
has been raised; the shipping immediately in front partly conceal
it; and the bold reef of rocks on the outside of these, with the
surf dashing violently against and over it, give to them the appearance
of being ashore; and as no outlet is seen, they seem to
be hemmed in. The small tower or fort at the northern end of
the reef, however, soon claims attention, and points out the entrance.
We approached the land rather to the southward of the
town, and coasted, under very easy sail, at a short distance from the
reef, waiting for a pilot. It was not yet noon, the sea was smooth,
the sun was bright, and every thing looked pleasant. The buildings
are all white-washed; the sun shone upon them, and gave to them
a glittering silvery appearance.</p>

<p class="vh"><a name="i018" id="i018">i018</a></p>

<div class="figcenter">

     <div class="caption"><p class="pc"><i>A Jangada.</i></p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p>Nothing this day created so much astonishment on board our ship,
amongst those who had not been before upon this coast, as the
<i>Jangadas</i>, sailing about in all directions. These are simply rafts of
six logs, of a peculiar species of light timber, lashed or pinned together;
a large latine sail; a paddle used as a rudder; a sliding
keel let down between the two centre logs; a seat for the steersman,
and a long forked pole, upon which is hung the vessel containing
water, the provisions, &amp;c. These rude floats have a most singular
appearance at sea, no hull being apparent even when near them.
They are usually managed by two men, and go closer to the wind
than any description of vessel.</p>

<p>A large row-boat at last made its appearance, doubling the end of
the reef near the small fort, which was declared to be that which
brings off the pilots. The <i>patram-mor</i>, harbour-master, in his naval
uniform, likewise came on board. A large launch followed the
pilot, manned chiefly by negroes, almost naked; the colour of
these men; the state in which they were; their noise and bustle,
when certainly there was no occasion for it, and their awkwardness,
were to me all new. This very first communication with the shore
gave me an idea, for the moment, that the manners of the country at
which I had arrived, were still more strange than they actually proved
to be. These visitors were followed by others of a very different
description; two boats came alongside, manned by Englishmen, and
conveying several English gentlemen. The former belonged to
British ships loading in the harbour, and the latter were young men
who had come out to Pernambuco to settle as merchants.</p>

<p>The pilot placed himself near to the ship’s windlass; a Portugueze
sailor was sent to take the helm, but still the vociferation was extreme;
the man seemed to think that, by speaking very loud, he
would make the English seamen understand his language; and what
with his bawling to them and to his own people, and their noise, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
confusion was excessive; however, we doubled the fort in safety, and
came to anchor in the upper harbour. The reef is very perpendicular
near to the bar; and to one unacquainted with the port, there is every
appearance of the vessel being about to drive upon it. I then accompanied
my fellow-passenger; we left the ship and proceeded to the
shore. Here was a new scene indeed. We had taken the letter-bag with
us; the crowd of well-dressed persons upon the quay was great; they
saw the bag, and soon their anxiety for news overcame their politeness;
the letters were asked for, and at last we gave them up, and they were
scrambled for, each man seeking his own. We had landed at the
custom-house wharf upon a busy day, and the negroes too were all
clamour and bustle. Their hideous noise when carrying any load,
bawling out some ditty of their own language, or some distich of
vulgar Portugueze rhyme; the numerous questions asked by many
persons who met us, and the very circumstance of seeing a population
consisting chiefly of individuals of a dark colour, added to the
sound of a new language, with which, although I was acquainted, still
I had not since very early youth been in a country where it was generally
spoken; all combined to perplex and to confuse. I was led
along by those who were accustomed to these scenes, and we proceeded
to the house of one of the first merchants in the place. We
were ushered up one pair of stairs into a room in which were several
piles of piece-goods, a table covered with papers, and several chairs.
There were four or five persons in the room besides the owner of the
house. I delivered my letter of introduction to him, and was treated
with the greatest civility. Our next visit was to a colonel, who is
also a merchant, from whom I met with the same behaviour.</p>

<p>As there are no inns or furnished lodgings at Recife, or at<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>Olinda,
an acquaintance of my fellow-passenger obtained some temporary
rooms for us, and supplied us with what we wanted. We are therefore
at last quietly settled in our new habitation, if I may be allowed
to call it quiet, whilst some twenty black women are under the windows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
bawling out, in almost all tones and keys of which the human
voice is capable,&mdash;oranges, bananas, sweetmeats, and other commodities,
for sale.</p>

<p>The town of St. Antonio do Recife, commonly called Pernambuco,
though the latter is properly the name of the captaincy, consists of
three compartments, connected by two bridges. A narrow, long neck
of sand stretches from the foot of the hill, upon which Olinda is situated
to the southward. The southern extremity of this bank expands
and forms the site of that part of the town particularly called
Recife, as being immediately within the reef. There is another
sand-bank also of considerable extent, upon which has been built the
second division, called St. Antonio, connected with that already mentioned
by means of a bridge. Yet a third division of the town
remains to be mentioned, called Boa Vista, which stands upon the
main land to the southward of the other two, and is joined to them
also by a bridge. The <i>recife</i>, or reef of rocks already spoken of, runs
in front of these sand-banks, and receives upon it the principal force
of the sea, which, at the flow of the tide, rolls over it, but is much
checked by it, and strikes the quays and buildings of the town with
diminished strength. The greatest part of the extent of sand between
Olinda and the town which remains uncovered, is open to the
sea, and the surf there is very violent. Buildings have only been
raised within the protection of the reef. The tide enters between
the bridges, and encircles the middle compartment. On the land
side there is a considerable expanse of water, having much the appearance
of a lake, which becomes narrower towards Olinda, and
reaches to the very streets of that place, thus facilitating the communication
between the two towns. The view from the houses that
look on to these waters is very extensive and very beautiful; their
opposite banks are covered with trees and white-washed cottages,
varied by small open spaces and lofty coco trees.</p>

<p>The first division of the town is composed of brick houses of three,
four, and even five stories in height; most of the streets are narrow,
and some of the older houses in the minor streets are of only one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
story in height, and many of them consist only of the ground-floor.
The streets of this part, with the exception of one, are paved. In
the Square are the custom-house, in one corner, a long, low, and
shabby building; the sugar-inspection, which bears the appearance
of a dwelling-house; a large church, not finished; a coffee-house,
in which the merchants assemble to transact their commercial affairs;
and dwelling-houses. There are two churches in use, one of which
is built over the stone arch-way leading from the town to Olinda, at
which a lieutenant’s guard is stationed. The other church belongs
to the priests of the <i>Congregaçam da Madre de Deos</i>. Near to the
gate-way above-mentioned is a small fort, close to the water-side,
which commands it. To the northward is the residence of the Port-Admiral,
with the government timber-yards attached to it: these are
small, and the work going on in them is very trifling. The cotton-market,
warehouses, and presses, are also in this part of the town.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>The bridge which leads to St. Antonio has an arch-way at either
end, with a small chapel built upon each; and at the northern arch
is stationed a serjeant’s guard of six or eight men. The bridge is
formed in part of stone arches, and in part of wood: it is quite flat,
and lined with small shops, which render it so narrow that two carriages
cannot pass each other upon it.</p>

<p>St. Antonio, or the middle town, is composed chiefly of large
houses and broad streets; and if these buildings had about them any
beauty, there would exist here a certain degree of grandeur: but
they are too lofty for their breadth, and the ground-floors are appropriated
to shops, warehouses, stables, and other purposes of a like
nature. The shops are without windows, and the only light they
have is admitted from the door. There exists as yet very little distinction
of trades; thus all descriptions of manufactured goods are
sold by the same person. Some of the minor streets consist of low<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
and shabby houses. Here are the Governor’s palace, which was in
other times the Jesuits’ convent; the treasury; the town-hall and
prison; the barracks, which are very bad; the Franciscan, Carmelite,
and Penha convents, and several churches, the interiors of
which are very handsomely ornamented, but very little plan has
been preserved in the architecture of the buildings themselves. It
comprises several squares, and has, to a certain degree, a gay and
lively appearance. This is the principal division of the town.</p>

<p>The bridge which connects St. Antonio with Boa Vista is constructed
entirely of wood, and has upon it no shops, but is likewise
narrow. The principal street of Boa Vista, which was formerly a
piece of ground overflowed at high water, is broad and handsome:
the rest of this third division consists chiefly of small houses, and as
there is plenty of room here, it extends to some distance in a straggling
manner. Neither the streets of this part of the town nor of St.
Antonio are paved. A long embankment has likewise been made,
which connects the sand-bank and town of St. Antonio with the main
land at Affogados<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>, to the south and west of Boa Vista. The river
Capibaribe, so famous in Pernambucan history, discharges its waters
into the channel between St. Antonio and Boa Vista, after having
run for some distance in a course nearly east and west.</p>

<p>Some few of the windows of the houses are glazed, and have iron
balconies: but the major part are without glass, and of these the
balconies are enclosed by lattice-work; and no females are to be seen,
excepting the negro slaves, which gives a very sombre look to the
streets. The Portugueze<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>, the Brazilian, and even the Mulatto
women, in the middle ranks of life, do not move out of doors in the
day-time; they hear mass at the churches before day-light-, and do
not again stir out, excepting in sedan chairs, or in the evening on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
foot, when occasionally a whole family will sally forth to take
a walk.</p>

<p>The upper harbour of Recife, called the Mosqueiro, as has been
already said, is formed by the reef of rocks which runs parallel with
the town at a very small distance. The lower harbour, for vessels
of 400 tons and upwards, called the Poço, is very dangerous, as it is
open to the sea, and the beach opposite to it is very steep. The
large Brazil ships, belonging to merchants of the place, lie here for
months at a time, moored with four cables, two a-head and two
a-stern. If precautions are not taken very speedily, the entrance to
the harbour of Mosqueiro will be choaked up, owing to a breach in
the reef, immediately within the small fort, which is called Picam.
The port has two entrances, one of which is deeper than the other.
The tide does not rise more than five and a half feet. The principal
defence of the town consists in the forts Do Buraco<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> and Do Brum,
both of which are built of stone, and are situated upon the sands
opposite to the two entrances. Likewise there is the small fort of
Bom Jezus, near to the arch-way and church of the same name; and
upon the south-east point of the sand-bank of St. Antonio stands the
large stone fort of Cinco Pontas, so called from its pentagonal form.
They are said to be all out of order. From what I have stated, it
will be seen that the ground upon which the town has been built is
most peculiarly circumstanced, and that the manner in which the
harbour is formed is equally rare.</p>

<p>The town is principally supplied with water, which is brought in
canoes, either from Olinda, or from the river Capibaribe, above the
influence of the tide; it comes in bulk, and although the greater
part of the vessels are decked, still it is usually filthy, as too much
care is not taken in their cleanliness. The wells that are sunk in
the sand upon which the town stands only afford brackish water.</p>

<p>The three compartments of the town, together, contain about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
25,000 inhabitants, or more, and it is increasing rapidly; new
houses are building wherever space can be found. The population
consists of white persons, of mulatto and black free people, and of
slaves also of several shades.</p>

<p>The reef of rocks, of which I have before spoken, continues along
the whole coast between Pernambuco and Maranham, and in some
parts it runs at a very short distance from the shore; and in this
case is usually high, remaining uncovered at low water, as at
Recife; but in other places it recedes from the land, and is then
generally concealed. It has numberless breaks in it, through which
the communication with the sea is laid open.</p>

<p>Recife is a thriving place, increasing daily in opulence and importance.
The prosperity which it enjoys may be in some measure
attributed to the character of its Governor and Captain-General,
Caetano Pinto de Miranda Montenegro, who has ruled the province
for the last ten years with systematic steadiness and uniform prudence.
He has made no unnecessary innovations, but he has
allowed useful improvements to be introduced. He has not, with
hurried enthusiastic zeal, which often defeats its end, pushed forwards
any novelty that struck him at the moment, but he has given
his consent and countenance to any proposal backed by respectable
persons. He has not interfered and intermeddled with those concerns in
which governments have no business, but he has supported them when
they have been once established. I here speak of commercial regulations
and minor improvements in the chief town, and in the
smaller settlements of the country. He is affable, and hears the
complaint of a peasant or a rich merchant with the same patience;
he is just, seldom exercising the power which he possesses of punishing
without appeal to the civil magistrate; and when he does enforce
it, the crime must be very glaring indeed. He acts upon a
system, and from principle; and if it is the fate of Brazil to be in
the hands of a despotic government, happy, compared to its present
state, would it in general be, if all its rulers resembled him. I love<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
the place at which I so long resided, and I hope most sincerely that
he may not be removed, but that he may continue to dispense
to that extensive region, the blessings of a mild, forbearing administration.</p>

<p>In political consequence, with reference to the Portuguese government,
Pernambuco holds the third<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> rank amongst the provinces
of Brazil; but in a commercial point of view, with reference
to Great Britain, I know not whether it should not be named first.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
Its chief exports are cotton and sugar; the former mostly comes to
England, and may be accounted at 80,000 or 90,000 bags annually,
averaging 160 pounds weight each bag. The latter is chiefly shipped
to Lisbon. Hides, cocoa-nuts, ipecacuanha, and a few other drugs,
are also occasionally sent from thence, but are exported in trifling
quantities. These articles are exchanged for manufactured goods,
earthenware, porter, and other articles of necessity among civilized
people, and also of luxury to no very great amount. Two or
three ships sail annually for Goa in the East Indies; and the trade
to the coast of Africa for slaves is considerable. Several vessels
from the United States arrive at Recife annually, bringing flour, of
which great quantities are now consumed; furniture for dwelling-houses,
and other kinds of lumber, and carrying away sugar, molasses,
and rum. During the late war between the United States and
England, which interrupted this trade, Recife was at first somewhat
distressed for wheat-flour, but a supply arrived from Rio Grande do
Sul, the most southern province of the kingdom of Brazil.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
quality is good<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>, and I rather think that some coasting-vessels will
continue to supply the market with this article, notwithstanding the
renewed communication with North America.</p>

THURSDAY.&mdash;GOOD FRIDAY.&mdash;EASTER SUNDAY.&mdash;PROFESSION OF A

VISIT TO OLINDA.</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">THE numerous arrangements necessary on our arrival, prevented
our making immediately the customary visit to the governor;
but on the following morning we proceeded to the palace, situated in
a small square, with the guard-house on one side, at which is
stationed a captain’s guard. We were ushered up stairs, remained
some time in an anti-chamber with several cadets, and were then
desired to enter; we passed the secretary’s room, and were shown
into a very spacious apartment, in which the governor waited to
receive us. He is a large handsome man, with quite the manners
of a gentleman; we all sat down, and he asked several questions
respecting affairs in Europe; I had some English newspapers, which
I left with him, and in about half an hour we retired.</p>

<p>The first few days after my arrival were spent in delivering my
letters of introduction. I soon became acquainted with all the
English merchants, who live in a very respectable style, and have
done much good in establishing some customs which the Portugueze
have had the sense to follow, preserving at the same time those of
their own, which are fitted to the country and the climate.</p>

<p>As this was the summer season, great numbers of the inhabitants
were out of town; they remove to small cottages at Olinda, and upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
the banks of the rivers, to enjoy a purer air, and the amusement and
comfort of bathing, during the months most subject to hot, parching
weather. The heat is, however, seldom very oppressive; the sea-breeze,
during the whole year, commences about nine o’clock in the
morning, and continues until midnight. When exposed to it, even
standing in the sun, the heat is so much alleviated by its influence, as
to make the person so situated forget, for a moment, that in the shade
he would be cooler. At the time this subsides the land-breeze rises,
and continues until early in the morning, and the half hour in the
forenoon which occasionally passes between the one and the other, is
the most unpleasant period of the day. In the rainy season, just
before the commencement of a heavy shower, the clouds are very
dark, dense, and low; the breeze is suspended for a short time; there
is then a sort of expectant stillness, and the weather is very sultry.</p>

<p>One afternoon I rode out with several young men to a village in
the neighbourhood, for the purpose of delivering a letter to one of
the rich merchants. We passed through Boa Vista, and proceeded
along a narrow sandy road, formed by frequent passing and repassing;
and along the sides of this are many of the summer residences of the
wealthy inhabitants of the town, which are small, neat, white-washed
cottages of one floor, with gardens in front and at the sides, planted
with orange, lemon, pomegranate, and many other kinds of fruit-trees;
some few are inclosed partly by low walls, but for the most
part they are protected by fences of timber. About half way we
came out upon the banks of the Capibaribe; the view is exceedingly
pretty; houses, trees, and gardens on each side: the river bends just
above, and appears lost among the trees; the canoes going gently
down with the tide, or more laboriously forcing their way up against
it, formed altogether a delightful prospect. The river is here rather
narrower than the Thames at Richmond. Along the sides of the
road, at this spot, are several black women selling oranges, other kinds
of fruits and cakes, and canoe-men with their long poles, unable to
delay, bargaining with them for some of their commodities. This was
the first time I had left the town, and I was truly pleased with these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
first looks of the country of which I had become an inhabitant. We
again left the river, continuing along the road, still bordered by cottages
of a better or worse appearance, until we reached a small village;
through this we passed, and soon afterwards arrived at the end of our
ride. The situation is very picturesque, upon the northern bank of
the Capibaribe, and at the foot of a steep hill clothed with wood.
On our arrival at the house, we entered immediately from the road
into a hall with a brick floor, of which the doors and windows are
very large, so as to leave the front very nearly open. We were
received by the lady of the house, and her husband soon appeared;
they were exceedingly civil, and ordered sweetmeats to be
brought out.</p>

<p>Our English flat saddles created as much surprise to the people of
Pernambuco, as those of the Portugueze appeared strange to us.
They are high before and behind, which obliges the rider to sit
very upright, and the fashion is to be as stiff as possible, and to hold
quite perpendicularly a switch of most enormous length. The horses
are taught a delightful amble, upon which some of them can be made
to proceed with great speed.</p>

<p>The river Capibaribe is navigable during the whole year as far as
Apepucos, half a league beyond Monteiro, the village at which my
new acquaintance was now residing. It overflows its banks in the
rainy season, oftentimes with great rapidity. As the lands through
which it runs in this part of the country are very low, the floods are
somewhat dreaded, as they occasionally extend far and wide. The straw
hovels upon its banks are often carried away, and the whole neighbourhood
is laid under water: canoes have been known to ply between
this village and those of Poço da Panella and Caza Forte.</p>

<p>A Portugueze friend, with whom I had been acquainted in England,
having taken a house at the former of the two last-mentioned places,
I agreed to share the expence of it with him, and we immediately
removed to it, to pass the summer months. The village was quite full;
not a hut remained untenanted; and, as occurs in England at watering-places,
families, whose dwellings in town were spacious and handsome<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
regardless of inconvenience, came to reside here during the summer in
very small cottages. The Poço da Panella contains a chapel, built by
subscription, a row of houses running parallel with the river, several
washerwomen’s huts in front of them, and other dwellings scattered
about in all directions. Here the ceremonious manners of the town
are thrown aside, and exchanged for an equal degree of freedom. Our
mornings were filled up, either in riding to the Recife or to some
other part of the country, or in conversation at the houses of any of
the families with whom we were acquainted; and the afternoons and
evenings with music, dancing, playing at forfeits, or in dining with
some of the English merchants, a few of whom had also removed to
this place and its neighbourhood. At many of the Portugueze houses
I found the card-tables occupied at nine o’clock in the morning;
when one person rose another took his place; and thus they were
scarcely deserted, except during the heat of the day, when each man
either returned to his own home to dine, or, as is much less frequent,
was requested to remain and partake with the family.</p>

<p>On the last day of this year I was invited to visit Olinda, that I might
witness the festival of Our Lady of the Mountain. The city is, as I have
already observed, situated upon a hill, very steep in front of the
sea, and declining gradually on the land side. Its first appearance,
on arriving upon the coast, is so beautiful, that the disappointment
experienced on entering it is great; but still Olinda has many
beauties, and the view from it is magnificent. The streets are paved,
but are much out of repair; many of the houses are small, low, and
neglected, and the gardens very little cultivated; indeed the place has
been deserted for the Recife. However, one of the regiments of the
line is stationed here<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>; it is the residence of the bishop, and the site
of the ecclesiastical court, the seminary, which is a public college of
education, and some convents and fine churches; therefore, it is by no
means desolate, though its general aspect bespeaks tranquillity, regularity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
and a degree of neglect. The view to the southward takes in
a lake of about three miles in length, of which the surface is covered
with weeds and grass, and the opposite banks lined with thick woods
and some cottages; the Recife and the bay behind it, formed by the
entrance of the tide, extending to Olinda, but concealed in places by
low and thick mangroves are also to be seen. Olinda covers much
ground, but contains only about 4000 inhabitants. At this time the
whole city presented a scene of bustle and amusement. The church,
particularly decorated on this occasion, stands upon the highest point;
the assemblage of persons was great; the church was lighted up, and
a few individuals of both sexes were kneeling promiscuously in the
body of it, but the service was over.</p>

<p>This is the season of cheerfulness and gaiety, and we were likewise
to have our festival at the Poço da Panella. These festivals are always
preceded by nine evenings of hymn-singing, and music, in honour of
the Virgin, or the saint whose day is to be thus celebrated. On this
occasion the performance for the <i>novena</i>, or nine evenings, consisted
of a piano-forte played by a lady, the wife of a merchant, and a guitar,
and some wind-instruments, played by several young men of
respectability. The vocal music was also executed by the same persons,
assisted by some female mulatto slaves belonging to the lady.
I was somewhat surprised to hear the airs of country-dances and
marches occasionally introduced. However, on the day of the
festival, the performers were professional men, and in the evening fireworks
were displayed. Every house in the village was crowded this
day with people from all parts. My friend and I had several persons
to dinner, but before we had half finished, some of <i>their</i> friends
appeared, and without ceremony came in and helped themselves;
soon all idea of regularity vanished, and things were scrambled for.
In a short time both of us left our own house, and tried to gain admittance
to some other, but all were in the same confusion. We
were invited to a dance in the evening, at which the Governor was
present; and although he is himself desirous of making every person
feel at ease, still such is the dreadful idea of rank, for I know not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
what else to call it, in this country, that the behaviour of every one
was constrained, and the conversation carried on almost in a whisper.</p>

<p>I lost no Festivals, and amongst others, went to that of St.
Amaro, the healer of wounds, at whose chapel are sold bits of ribbon,
as charms, which many individuals of the lower orders of people
tie round their naked ancles or their wrists, and preserve until they
wear out, and drop off.</p>

<p>About the commencement of Lent, the villages in the neighbourhood
are almost entirely deserted by the white people, who return
to town to see the processions customary at this season in Catholic
countries. The rains also usually begin about the end of March.
I did not leave the Poço de Panella until the very last, but in the
end found the place dull, and followed the rest.</p>

<p>On Holy Thursday, accompanied by two of my countrymen, I
sallied forth at three o’clock, to see the churches, which are, on this
occasion, lighted up, and highly ornamented. The whole town was
in motion; the females, too, both high and low, were this afternoon
parading the streets on foot, contrary to their usual custom; many of
them were dressed in silks of different colours, and covered with
gold chains and other trinkets, a general muster being made of all
the finery that could be collected. The blaze in some of the
churches, from great numbers of wax tapers, was prodigious; the
object apparently aimed at was the production of the greatest quantity
of light, as in some instances mirrors were fixed behind the
tapers. The middle of the body of these churches is completely
open; there are no pews, no distinction of places; the principal
chapel is invariably at the opposite end from the chief entrance,
recedes from the church, and is narrower; this part is appropriated
to the officiating priests, and is railed in from the body of the
church. The females, as they enter, whether white or of colour,
place themselves as near to the rails as they can, squatting down
upon the floor of the large open space in the centre. The men stand
along either side of the body of the church, a narrow slip being in
most instances railed off lengthways; or they remain near to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
entrance, behind the women; but every female, of whatever rank or
colour, is first accommodated.</p>

<p>On the following day, Good Friday, the decorations of the
churches, the dress of the women, and even the manner of both
sexes was changed; all was dismal. In the morning I went with
the same gentlemen to the church of the Sacramento, to witness a
representation of our Saviour’s descent from the Cross. We entered
the church by a side door; it was much crowded, and the difficulty
of getting in was considerable. An enormous curtain hung from the
ceiling, excluding from the sight the whole of the principal chapel.
An Italian Missionary Friar of the Penha convent, with a long
beard, and dressed in a thick dark brown cloth habit, was in the
pulpit, and about to commence an extempore sermon. After an
exordium of some length, adapted to the day, he cried out “Behold
him;” the curtain immediately dropped, and discovered an enormous
Cross, with a full-sized wooden image of our Saviour, exceedingly
well carved and painted, and around it a number of angels represented
by several young persons, all finely decked out, and each
bearing a large pair of out-stretched wings, made of gauze; a man,
dressed in a bob wig, and a pea green robe, as St. John, and a female
kneeling at the foot of the Cross, as the Magdalen; whose character,
as I was informed, seemingly that nothing might be wanting, was not
the most pure. The friar continued, with much vehemence, and
much action, his narrative of the crucifixion, and after some minutes,
again cried out “Behold, they take him down;” when four men,
habited in imitation of Roman soldiers, stepped forwards. The
countenances of these persons were in part concealed by black crape.
Two of them ascended ladders placed on each side against the Cross,
and one took down the board, bearing the letters I.N.R.I. Then
was removed the crown of thorns, and a white cloth was put over,
and pressed down upon the head; which was soon taken off, and
shown to the people, stained with the circular mark of the crown in
blood: this done, the nails which transfix the hands, were by degrees
knocked out, and this produced a violent beating of breasts among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
the female part of the congregation. A long white linen bandage
was next passed under each arm-pit of the image; the nail which
secured the feet was removed; the figure was let down very gently,
and was carefully wrapped up in a white sheet. All this was done
by word of command from the preacher. The sermon was then
quickly brought to a conclusion, and we left the church. I was quite
amazed; I had heard that something of this kind was to be done,
but I had no idea of the extent to which the representation would
be carried.</p>

<p>On Saturday morning we were saluted with the bellowing of cattle,
the grunting of pigs, and the cries of the negro slaves with baskets of
fowls of several kinds for sale; these were to be devoured after the
ensuing midnight, and many families, weary of their long abstinence,
impatiently awaited the striking of the clocks, as a signal for the commencement
of hostile operations, without mercy or scruple, upon
turkies, pigs, &amp;c. and all the rest of the miserable tribes which have
been laid down as the lawful victims of our carnivorous nature.</p>

<p>On Easter Sunday I was invited by a physician to dine with him,
and to attend the christening of one of his grandchildren. At dinner
the party was small; the dishes, were served up two at a time to
the number of ten or twelve, of all of which I was obliged to taste.
From the table we adjourned to the church about four o’clock, where
several persons, likewise invited, waited for us; the ceremony was
performed by a friar, and each guest held a wax taper, forming a
semicircle towards the altar; from hence we returned to the old
gentleman’s house to supper. I met here, among others belonging
to the same convent, the friar who preached the crucifixion sermon.
The members of this convent are all Italians and Missionaries, but
as no reinforcement has for a length of time come out from Europe,
very few now remain. A long table was laid out, loaded with victuals.
Several ladies were present, notwithstanding which enormous
quantities of wine were drank, until the whole company began to be
riotous, but still the ladies did not move. At last no order was left
among them, bottles and glasses were overturned and broken in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
vehement wishes expressed for the prosperity of the whole family of
our host, both old and young; when in the midst of this, I escaped
about nine o’clock, accompanied by a Franciscan friar. We had a
journey in contemplation for the next day, and thought it high time
to get away. Parties of this kind are not frequent, and in a general
way these people live in a very quiet manner. The old Doctor
is a native of Lisbon, and a great friend to Englishmen; he was
young at the time of the great earthquake, and says he shall never
forget that he was in part cloathed from the necessaries sent out by
the British government for the assistance of the Portugueze after that
dreadful calamity.</p>

<p>On the following afternoon, the friar, myself, and a servant, proceeded
to Iguaraçu, a small town distant from Recife seven leagues,
for the purpose of witnessing the entrance of a novice into the Order
of St. Francis. We arrived about nine o’clock at night at the gates
of the convent; the friar rang the bell three times, as the signal
of the arrival of one of the Order; a lay brother came, and asked
who it was that demanded admittance; he was answered, that
it was brother Joseph from the convent of Recife accompanied by a
friend; the porter shut the gates again, but soon returned, saying
that the Guardian, the name given to the principal of a Franciscan
convent, allowed us to enter. We were conducted up a flight of
steps into a long corridore, at the end of which sat the Guardian, to
whom we were introduced; he directed us to the brother who had
the management of the accommodations for visitors; this man placed
us under the especial care of Frei Luiz, who took us to his cell. Supper
was served up, upon which the Guardian came in, helped us once
round to wine and made many apologies for the badness of his cook,
and also excuses for the want of ingredients at this distance from
Recife. The convents of St. Francis are all built exactly upon the
same plan; in the form of a quadrangle, one side of which is appropriated
to the church, and the remaining three to cells and to other
purposes; the former are above, and to be entered from a gallery,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
which runs round the whole building. The beds with which the
friars supplied us were hard, but very acceptable after our ride.</p>

<p>The ceremony to be performed on the ensuing morning collected
great numbers of persons from all quarters, as it is now very rare.
Formerly, of every family at least one member was a friar, but now
this is not the custom; children are brought up to trade, to the army,
to any thing rather than to a monastic life, which is fast losing its
reputation. None of the convents are full, and some of them are
nearly without inhabitants.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>Early in the morning the church was lighted up, and about ten
o’clock the family of the person about to take the vows arrived to
occupy the seats prepared for them. Mass was then said, and a sermon
preached; about eleven o’clock the novice, a young man of
sixteen years of age, entered the principal chapel by a side door, walking
between two brothers, with a large cross in his hands, and dressed
in a long dark blue robe: there was then much chanting, after which
he knelt down opposite to the Guardian, received the usual admonitions,
was asked several questions relating to his belief in the doctrines
of the church, and then made the separate vows, of defending his religion,
of celibacy, and others of minor importance. The Guardian
then dressed him in the habit of the Order, made of very thick, rough,
dark brown cloth, which before lay stretched upon the ground in
front of the altar, covered with flowers; this being done, the young
man embraced all the brothers present, took leave of his relations,
and left the church. Many of the friars were laughing during the
ceremony, and were particularly amused at the Guardian accidentally
saying, “Brother, don’t be ashamed<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>;” owing to the young man being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
much abashed. A visitor who stood near to me in the gallery,
from which there are windows into the church, said, in a low voice
to be heard only by those immediately around him; “See your chief
himself thus advises him to put shame aside, which unfortunately you
are all too much inclined to do;” at this the friars who were within
hearing all laughed. Great part of the community and many other
persons dined with the father of the young friar, and I among the
rest; there was much eating, much drinking, and much confusion. In
the evening fireworks were displayed, which ended by a transparency,
representing a novice receiving the benediction of his Guardian.</p>

<p>It was determined that we should return to Recife this night, and
that the journey was to be commenced as soon as the moon rose.
The party consisted of five friars, several laymen besides myself all
on horseback; some palanquins with ladies, and a number of negroes
to carry them. We sallied forth about midnight; the moon was
bright, and the sky quite clear. The scene was very strange; the
road made in places abrupt turns, so as to give to those who were
rather in advance, on looking back, a view of the whole procession,
at times appearing and at times concealed among the trees; of
this the friars formed an extraordinary part, in their robes tucked up
round the waist, and tied with the long yellow cord of flagellation, and
with their enormous white hats. At Olinda several persons remained,
and the rest arrived at Recife about seven o’clock in the morning.</p>

<p>On the 10th of May I had a sudden attack of fever, which
was accompanied with delirium; however, with the assistance of a
medical man, the disorder subsided in the course of forty-eight hours,
but it left me in a very weak state, from which I was some time in
recovering. These fevers are well known in the country, but are not
common, and in general are preceded for some days by ague. I can
only account for this attack, from having suffered the window of my
room, which had a western aspect, to remain open during the night,
and the land breeze which rises about twelve o’clock is not accounted
wholesome. A young Englishman insisted upon my removal
to his house, that I might not remain in the hands of servants;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
he brought a palanquin for this purpose, and made me get into it.
With him I remained until my health was completely re-established,
and was treated by him with that sort of kindness which can only
be expected from a very near relation.</p>

<p>I dined with a friend on St. Peter’s day, the 29th June, and in the
evening I proposed walking to the church, dedicated to this saint.
As usual, the blaze of light was great, the congregation numerous,
and the whole affair very brilliant. After the service, we recognised
a party of ladies with whom we were acquainted, and one of
them requested us to look for a young priest, her son; on making
enquiries, we were desired to walk up stairs into a large room over
the vestry, in which were several priests, and a table covered with
refreshments of many descriptions. The young man came to us, and
was soon followed by others, who invited us to stay and partake, but
we declined and went down to the party we had joined; some of the
priests accompanied us, and persuaded the ladies to ascend, and have
a share of the good things; we were also requested to return, which
we did. There were great quantities of fruit, cakes, sweetmeats, and
wine. We met with the most marked attention from these ministers
of the Roman Catholic religion; greater politeness could not have
been shown to any person; even many with whom we had not been
acquainted before, offered us wine, and requested to be introduced to
us. I mention the conduct of these men more particularly, as I think
it showed a great degree of liberality, and a wish to conciliate, and
more especially as there were likewise several laymen present of their
own nation<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>. About ten o’clock we left the church, and taking one
family of our party home, remained with them until a very late
hour.</p>

<p>We were invited to pass the following Sunday with this family,
which consisted of the father and mother, and a son and daughter;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
they were all Brazilians, and though the young lady had never been
from Pernambuco, her manners were easy; and her conversation
lively and entertaining. Her complexion was not darker than
that of the Portugueze in general, her eyes and hair black, and
her features on the whole good; her figure small, but well shaped.
Though I have seen others handsomer, still this lady may be
accounted a very fair sample of the white Brazilian females; but
it is among the women of colour that the finest persons are to be
found,&mdash;more life and spirit, more activity of mind and body; they
are better fitted to the climate, and the mixed race seems to be its
proper inhabitant. Their features too are often good, and even
the colour, which in European climates is disagreeable, appears to
appertain to that in which it more naturally exists; but this bar to European
ideas of beauty set aside, finer specimens of the human form
cannot be found than among the mulatto females whom I have seen.</p>

<p>We went to them to breakfast, which was of coffee and cakes.
Backgammon and cards were then introduced until dinner time, at
two o’clock. This consisted of great numbers of dishes, placed
upon the table without any arrangement, and brought in without any
regard to the regularity of courses. We were, as may be supposed,
rather surprised at being complimented with pieces of meat from
the plates of various persons at the table. I have often met with
this custom, particularly amongst families in the interior, and this I
now speak of had only resided in Recife a short time; but many
of the people of the town have other ideas on these matters. Two
or three knives only were placed upon the table, which obliged
each person to cut all the meat upon his own plate into small pieces,
and pass the knife to his next neighbour. There was, however, a
plentiful supply of silver forks, and abundance of plates. Garlic
formed one ingredient in almost every dish, and we had a great deal
of wine during the dinner. The moment we finished, every one rose
from the table, and removed into another apartment. At eight
o’clock a large party assembled to tea, and we did not take our departure
until a very late hour. On our arrival at home, my friend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
and I sat together to consider of the transactions of this day, which
we had thus passed entirely with a Brazilian family, and both agreed
that we had been much amused, and that we had really felt
much gratification, save the business at the dining table. The conversation
was trifling, but entertaining; there was much wit and
sport. The ladies of the house, joined by several others in the
evening, talked a great deal, and would allow of no subject into
which they could not enter.</p>

<p>It will be observed from what I have described, and from what I
still have to mention, that no rule can be laid down for the society of
the place in question; families of equal rank, and of equal wealth and
importance, are often of manners totally different. The fact is, that
society is undergoing a rapid change; not that the people imitate
European customs, though these have some effect, but as
there is more wealth, more luxuries are required; as there is more
education, higher and more polished amusements are sought for;
as the mind becomes more enlarged, from intercourse with other
nations, and from reading, many customs are seen in a different
light; so that, the same persons insensibly change, and in a few
years ridicule and are disgusted with many of those very habits
which, if they reflect for a moment, they will recollect were practised
but a short time before by themselves.</p>

<p>On St. Anne’s day, the 29th July, two young Englishmen and
myself proceeded by invitation to the house of one of the first personages
of Pernambuco; a man in place, and a planter, possessing
three sugar works in different parts of the country. About ten
o’clock in the morning, we embarked in a canoe, and were poled
and paddled across the bay, on the land side of the town. On our
arrival upon the opposite shore, the tide was out, and the mud deep;
in fear and trembling for our silks, two of us clang to the backs of
the canoe-men, who with some difficulty put us down safe on dry land;
but the third, who was heavier, for some minutes debated whether
to return home was not the better plan, however, he took courage,
and was, likewise, safely conducted through this region of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
of peril. We then walked up to the house, which covers much
ground, and of which the apartments are spacious, and all upon the
first floor. The garden was laid out by this gentleman’s father, in
the old style of straight walks, and trees cut into shapes. A large
party was already assembling, as this was the anniversary of the
birth-day of our hostess; but the females were all ushered into one
room, and the men into another; cards and backgammon, as usual,
were the amusements, but there was little of ease and freedom of
conversation. At dinner, the ladies all arranged themselves on one
side, and the men opposite to them; there were victuals of many kinds
in great profusion, and much wine was drank. Some of the gentlemen
who were intimately acquainted with the family, did not sit down
at table, but assisted in attending upon the ladies. After dinner, the
whole party adjourned into a large hall, and country dancing being
proposed and agreed to, fiddlers were introduced, and a little after
seven o’clock, about twenty couples commenced, and continued this
amusement until past two o’clock. Here was the ceremony of the
last century in the morning, and in the evening the cheerfulness of
an English party of the present day. I never partook of one more
pleasant; the conversation, at times renewed, was always genteel, but
unceremonious, and I met with several well-educated persons, whose
acquaintance I enjoyed during the remainder of my stay at this
place.</p>

<p>The rains this season had been very slight, and scarcely ever prevented
our rides into the country in the neighbourhood, to the
distance of six or eight miles; but we never reached beyond the
summer dwellings of the inhabitants of Recife. The villages are
at this time very dull, having people of colour and negroes as residents
almost exclusively. However, as I was fond of the country,
I was tempted by the fineness of the weather, to remove entirely to
a small cottage in the vicinity, where my time passed away
pleasantly, though quietly, and in a manner very barren of
events. There stands a hamlet not far distant from my new residence,
called Caza Forte, formerly the site of a sugar plantation, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
has been suffered to decay, and now the chapel alone remains to
point out the exact position. The dwelling-house of these works is
said to have been defended by the Dutch against the Portugueze, who
set fire to it, for the purpose of obliging their enemies to surrender.
A large open piece of ground is pointed out as having been the situation
upon which these transactions took place. It is distant from
Recife about five miles, and the river Capibaribe runs about three
quarters of a mile beyond it. I met with few of the peasants
who had any knowledge of the Pernambucan war against the Dutch,
but I heard this spot more frequently spoken of than any other<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>.
Perhaps if I had had more communication with the southern districts
of Pernambuco, I should have discovered that the war was more
vividly remembered there.</p>

<p>I had an offer of introduction to another Brazilian family, which I
readily accepted, and on the 7th August, I was summoned by my
friend to accompany him to Olinda. He had been invited, and
liberty had been given to take a friend. We went in a canoe, and
were completely wet through on the way; but we walked about the
streets of Olinda until we were again dry. The family consisted of
an old lady, her two daughters, and a son, who is a priest, and one of
the professors or masters of the seminary. Several persons of the
same class were present, of easy and gentlemanlike manners;
some of them proposed dancing, and although they did not join in the
amusement, still they were highly pleased to see others entertained in
this manner. Our music was a piano forte, played by one of the
professors, who good-humouredly continued until the dancers
themselves begged him to desist. About midnight, we left these
pleasant people, and returned to the beach; the tide was out, and
the canoe upon dry land; we therefore determined to walk; the
sand was very heavy, the distance three miles, and after our evening’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
amusement, this was hard work. I did not attempt this night to go
beyond Recife to my cottage, but accepted of a mattress at my friend’s
residence.</p>

<p>Three or four families are in the practice of having weekly evening
card parties, as was usual in Lisbon. I attended these occasionally,
but in them there was no peculiarity of customs.</p>

<p>The foregoing pages will, I think, suffice to point out the kind of
society to be met with in Pernambuco, but this must be sought for, as
the families in which it is to be found, are not numerous. Of
these, very few are in trade; they are either Portugueze families, of
which the chief is in office, or Brazilian planters who are wealthy,
and prefer residing in Recife or Olinda; or, as is frequently the case,
a son or brother belonging to the secular priesthood, has imbibed
more liberal notions, and has acquired a zest for rational society.
As may naturally be supposed, the females of a family are always
glad to be of more importance, to be treated with respect, to see, and
to be seen. The merchants, generally speaking, for there do exist
some exceptions, live very much alone; they have been originally
from Portugal, have made fortunes in trade, and have married in the
country; but most of them still continue to live as if they were not
yet sufficiently wealthy, or at least cannot persuade themselves to alter
their close and retired manner of living, and, excepting in the summer
months, when sitting upon the steps of their country residencies,
their families are not to be seen.</p>

<p>The gentleman, chiefly by whose kindness I had been introduced
and enabled to partake of the pleasantest society of Pernambuco,
was among the first British subjects, who availed themselves of the
free communication between England and Brazil, and he even
already observed a considerable change of manners in the higher
class of people. The decrease in the price of all articles of dress;
the facility of obtaining at a low rate, earthenware, cutlery, and table
linen; in fact, the very spur given to the mind by this appearance
of a new people among them; the hope of a better state of things,

in many persons, ideas which had long lain dormant; made
them wish to show, that they had money to expend, and that they
knew how it should be expended.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>It was the custom in Pernambuco, to uncover when passing a sentinel,
or on meeting a guard of soldiers marching through the streets.
Soon after the opening of the port to British shipping, three English
gentlemen accidentally met a corporal’s guard of four or five men,
and as they passed each other, one of the latter took off the hat of
one of the former, accompanying the action by an opprobrious expression;
the Englishmen resented the insult, attacked and absolutely
routed the guard. This dreadful mark of submission to military
power was universally refused by every British subject, and has
been very much discontinued even by the Portugueze. Another
annoyance to these visitors was the usual respect paid to the Sacrament,
carried with much pomp and ceremony to persons dangerously
ill. It was expected, that every one by whom it chanced to pass,
should kneel, and continue in that posture until it was out of sight;
here Englishmen, in some degree, conformed in proper deference to
the religion of the country, but the necessity of this also is wearing
off.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER III.</h2>

<p class="pch">THE GOVERNMENT.&mdash;THE TAXES.&mdash;THE PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS.&mdash;CRIMINALS.&mdash;PRISONS.&mdash;MILITARY
ESTABLISHMENTS.&mdash;THE ISLAND OF FERNANDO DE
NORONHA.</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">THE captaincies-general, or provinces of the first rank, in Brazil,
of which Pernambuco is one, are governed by captains-general
or governors, who are appointed for three years. At the end of this
period the same person is continued or not, at the option of the supreme
government. They are, in fact, absolute in power, but before
the person who has been nominated to one of these places can exercise
any of its functions, he is under the necessity of presenting his
credentials to the <i>Senado da Camara</i>, the chamber or municipality of
the principal town. This is formed of persons of respectability in
the place. The governor has the supreme and sole command of the
military force. The civil and criminal causes are discussed before
and determined by the <i>Ouvidor</i> and <i>Juiz de Fora</i>, the two chief judicial
officers, whose duties are somewhat similar, but the former is the
superior in rank. They are appointed for three years, and the term
may be renewed<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>. It is in these departments of the government<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
that the opportunities of amassing large fortunes are most numerous;
and certain it is that some individuals take advantage of them in a
manner which renders justice but a name. The governor can determine
in a criminal cause without appeal, but, if he pleases, he refers
it to the competent judge. The <i>Procurador da Coroa</i>, attorney-general,
is an officer of considerable weight. The <i>Intendente da
Marinha</i>, port admiral, is likewise consulted on matters of first importance;
as are also the <i>Escrivam da Fazenda Real</i>, chief of the
treasury, and the <i>Juiz da Alfandega</i>, comptroller of the customs.
These seven officers form the <i>Junta</i>, or council, which occasionally
meets to arrange and decide upon the affairs of the captaincy to which
they belong.</p>

<p>The ecclesiastical government is scarcely connected with that above
mentioned, and is administered by a bishop and a dean and chapter,
with his vicar-general, &amp;c. The governor cannot even appoint a
chaplain to the island of Fernando de Noronha, one of the dependencies
of Pernambuco, but acquaints the bishop that a priest is wanted,
who then nominates one for the place.</p>

<p>The number of civil and military officers is enormous; inspectors
innumerable&mdash;colonels without end, devoid of any objects to inspect&mdash;without
any regiments to command; judges to manage each trifling
department, of which the duties might all be done by two or three
persons; thus salaries are augmented; the people are oppressed, but
the state is not benefited.</p>

<p>Taxes are laid where they fall heavy upon the lower classes, and
none are levied where they could well be borne. A tenth is raised
in kind upon cattle, poultry, and agriculture, and even upon salt;
this in former times appertained, as in other christian countries, to
the clergy<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>. All the taxes are farmed to the highest bidders, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
this among the rest. They are parcelled out in extensive districts,
and are contracted for at a reasonable rate, but the contractors again
dispose of their shares in small portions; these are again retailed
to other persons, and as a profit is obtained by each transfer the
people must be oppressed, that these men may satisfy those
above them and enrich themselves. The system is in itself bad,
but is rendered still heavier by this division of the spoil. The tenth
of cattle, as I have already said, is levied in kind upon the estates in
the interior of the country, and, besides this, a duty of 320 <i>reis per
arroba</i> of 32 lbs. is paid upon the meat at the shambles, which amounts
to about twenty-five <i>per cent.</i> Fish pays the tenth, and afterwards a
fifteenth. Every transfer of immoveable property is subject to a duty
of ten <i>per cent.</i> and moveables to five <i>per cent.</i> Besides these, there
are many other taxes of minor importance. Rum, both for exportation
and home consumption, pays a duty of 80 <i>reis per canada</i><a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>,
which is sometimes a fourth of its value, but may be reckoned as from
fifteen to twenty <i>per cent.</i> Cotton pays the tenth, and is again taxed
at the moment of exportation 600 <i>reis per arroba</i> of 32 lbs. or about
1¼<i>d.</i> <i>per</i> lb. Nothing can be more injudicious, than this double duty
upon the chief article of exportation from that country to Europe.
The duties at the custom-house are fifteen <i>per cent.</i> upon imports, of
which the valuation is left in some measure to the merchant to whom
the property belongs. Here, I think, ten <i>per cent.</i> more might be
raised without being felt. A tax is paid at Pernambuco for lighting
the streets of the Rio de Janeiro, whilst those of Recife remain
in total darkness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>Now, although the expences of the provincial governments are
great, and absorb a very considerable proportion of the receipts,
owing to the number of officers employed in every department,
still the salaries of each are, in most instances, much too small to
afford a comfortable subsistence; consequently peculation, bribery,
and other crimes of the same description are to be looked for, and
they become so frequent as to escape all punishment or even notice;
though there are some men whose character is without reproach. The
governor of Pernambuco receives a salary of 4,000,000 <i>reis</i>, or about
1000<i>l.</i> <i>per annum</i>. Can this be supposed to be sufficient for a man
in his responsible situation, even in a country in which articles of
food are cheap? His honour, however, is unimpeached; not
one instance did I ever hear mentioned of improper conduct in
him; but the temptation and the opportunities of amassing money
are very great, and few are the persons who can resist them.</p>

<p>The only manufactory in Recife of any importance is that of gold
and silver trinkets of every description, and of gold lace, but the
quantities made of either are only sufficient for the demand of the
place. The women employ themselves very generally in making
thread lace and in embroidery, but the manufacture of these articles
is not sufficiently extensive to allow of exportation.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>The public institutions are not many, but, of those that exist, some
are excellent. The seminary at Olinda for the education of young
persons is well conducted, and many of its professors are persons of
knowledge and of liberality. It is intended principally to prepare the
students for the church as secular priests, and therefore all of them
wear a black gown and a cap of a peculiar form, but it is not necessary
that they should ultimately take orders. Free schools are also
established in most of the small towns in the country, in some of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
which the Latin language is taught, but the major part are adapted
only to give instruction in reading, writing, and arithmetic. Neither
in these nor in the seminary is any expence incurred by the pupils.
The Lazarus Hospital is neglected, but patients are admitted; the
other establishments for the sick are very miserable. Strange it is,
that fine churches should be built, whilst many individuals are suffered
to perish from the want of a suitable building under which to
shelter them. But the best institution of which Pernambuco has
to boast, in common with the mother country, is the <i>Roda dos
Engeitados</i>. Infants of doubtful birth are received, taken care of,
reared, and provided for. Every person knows what the wheel of a
convent is,&mdash;a cylindrical box open on one side, which is fixed in the
wall and turns upon a pivot; near to this is placed a bell, to be rung
when any thing is put into the box, that the inhabitants of the convent
may know when it should be turned. One of these wheels
stands ready night and day to receive the child&mdash;the bell is rung and
the box turns. Thus the lives of many are saved&mdash;thus numbers
are spared from shame. Never let it be imagined that births of a
secret nature will be more frequent, from the consideration that this
institution exists, but it removes all motives for unnatural conduct in
a mother, and it may sometimes produce reform of future conduct,
by the facility afforded of concealing what has already passed.</p>

<p>The friars are not numerous, though they are far too much
so. These useless beings<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> amount to about one hundred and fifty
in number at Olinda, Recife, Iguaraçu, and Paraiba<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>. But there are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
no nuns in the province, though of the establishments called <i>Recolhimentos</i>
or Retreats, three exist. These are directed by elderly
females, who have not taken any vows, and who educate young persons
of their own sex, and receive individuals whose conduct has been
incorrect, but whose characters are not notorious, and who are placed
here by their relations to prevent further shame. The number of
churches, chapels, and niches in the streets for saints, is quite preposterous;
to these are attached a multitude of religious lay brotherhoods,
of which the members are merchants, and other persons in
trade, and even some are composed of mulatto and black free people.
Some of these continually beg for a supply of wax, and other articles
to be consumed in honour of their patron. Almost every day
in the year, passengers are importuned in the streets, and the inhabitants
in their houses, by some of these people, and among others,
by the lazy Franciscan friars. A Portugueze gentleman refused to
give money for any of these purposes, but after each application,
threw into a bag, placed apart for the purpose, a 5 <i>reis</i> coin, the
smallest in use, and in value the third part of a penny. At the end
of a twelvemonth, he counted his 5 <i>reis</i> pieces, and found that they
amounted to 30,000 <i>reis</i>, about 8<i>l.</i> 6<i>s.</i> He then applied to the
vicar of his parish, requesting him to name some distressed person
to whom he should give the money.</p>

<p>The Holy Office or Inquisition has never had an establishment in
Brazil, but several priests resided in Pernambuco, employed as its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
familiars, and sometimes persons judged amenable to this most
horrid tribunal, have been sent under confinement to Lisbon. However,
the ninth article of the Treaty of Friendship and Alliance,
between the crowns of England and Portugal, signed at the Rio de
Janeiro in 1810, has completely determined, that the power of the
Inquisition shall not be recognised in Brazil. It will appear surprising
to English persons, that in a place so large as Recife, there
should be no printing press or bookseller. At the convent of the
<i>Madre de Deos</i>, are sold almanacks, prints and histories of the Virgin
and saints, and other productions of the same description, but of
very limited size, printed at Lisbon. The post-office is conducted in
a very irregular manner. The letters from England are usually delivered
at the house of the merchant to whom the ship which conveyed
them is consigned, or at the office of the British consul.
There is no established means of forwarding letters to any part of the
interior of the country, nor along the coast, so that the post-office
merely receives the letter bags which are brought by the small
vessels that trade with other ports along this coast, and sends the bags
from Pernambuco by the same conveyances, and as there is not any
regular delivery of letters, each person must inquire for his own at
the office. When the commerce of Brazil was trifling, compared to
its present state, a post-office managed in this manner was sufficient,
but in consequence of the increased activity of the trade along the
coast, and with Europe, some attention ought to be given to the
subject, to facilitate communication. There is a theatre at Recife,
in which are performed Portugueze farces, but the establishment is
most wretchedly conducted.</p>

<p>The Botanic Garden at Olinda is one of those institutions which
have arisen from the removal of the Court to South America; it is
intended as a nursery for exotic plants, from whence they are to be distributed
to those persons who are willing and capable of rearing them.
Thus the bread fruit tree has been introduced, the black pepper
plant, the large Otaheitan cane, and several others. I much fear,
however, that the zeal shown at the commencement has somewhat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
cooled. A botanist has been appointed with an adequate salary.
He is a Frenchman, who had resided at Cayenne, and with this
choice many persons were much dissatisfied, as it was thought, and
with good reason, that a Portugueze subject might have been found,
quite capable of taking the management of the garden.</p>

<p>The sight, of all others, the most offensive to an Englishman, is
that of the criminals, who perform the menial offices of the palace,
the barracks, the prisons, and other public buildings. They are
chained in couples, and each couple is followed by a soldier, armed
with a bayonet. They are allowed to stop at the shops, to obtain
any trifle which they may wish to purchase, and it is disgusting
to see with what unconcern the fellows bear this most disgraceful
situation, laughing and talking as they go along to each other, to
their acquaintance whom they may chance to meet, and to the
soldier who follows them as a guard<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>. The prisons are in a very
bad state, little attention being paid to the situation of their
inhabitants. Executions are rare at Pernambuco; the more
usual punishment inflicted, even for crimes of the first magnitude, is
transportation to the coast of Africa. White persons must be removed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
for trial to Bahia, for crimes of which the punishment is
death. Even to pass sentence of death upon a man of colour, or a
negro, several judicial officers must be present. There does not exist
here a regular police; when an arrest is to be effected in Recife or
its neighbourhood, two officers of justice are accompanied by soldiers,
from one or other of the regiments of the line, for this purpose. A
<i>ronda</i> or patrol, consisting of soldiers, parades the streets during the
night, at stated periods, but it is not of much service to the town.
Recife and its vicinity were formerly in a very tranquil state, owing
to the exertions of one individual; he was a sergeant in the
regiment of Recife, a courageous man, whose activity of mind and
body had had no field upon which to act, until he was employed in
the arduous task of apprehending criminals, and at last he received
special orders from the governor for patroling the streets of Recife,
Olinda, and the villages around them; he and his followers were
much dreaded, but at his death no one stepped into his place.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>The military establishment is much neglected. The regular troops
consist of two regiments of infantry, which ought to form together a
body of 2,500 men, but they seldom collect more effective than 600;
so that sufficient numbers can scarcely he mustered to do the
duty of the town of Recife, of Olinda, and the forts. Their pay is
less than 2¾<i>d.</i> <i>per</i> day, and a portion of the flour of the mandioc
weekly, and their clothing is afforded to them very irregularly.
From their miserable pay, rather more than one farthing <i>per</i> day is
held back for a religious purpose. Recruits are made of some of
the worst individuals in the province; this mode of recruiting, and
their most wretched pay, account completely for the depreciated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
character of the soldiers of the line<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>. They are formed chiefly of
Brazilians, and people of colour. Besides these regiments, the
militia of the town sometimes do duty without pay, and these make
but a sorry shew. The militia regiments, commanded by mulatto
and black officers, and formed entirely of men of these casts, are
very superior in appearance; but these I shall have again an opportunity
of mentioning.</p>

<p>There is one political arrangement of this province which, above
all others, cries aloud for alteration; it is a glaring, self-evident evil,
it is a disgrace upon the government which suffers its existence. I
speak of the small island of Fernando de Noronha. To this spot are
transported, for a number of years or for life, a great number of male
criminals. No females are permitted to visit the island. The garrison,
consisting of about 120 men, is relieved yearly. It is a very
difficult matter to obtain a priest to serve for a twelvemonth, as chaplain
in the island. When the bishop is applied to by the governor,
for a person of this calling, he sends some of his ecclesiastical officers
in search of one; the persons of the profession, who are liable
to be sent, conceal themselves, and the matter usually concludes by
a young priest being literally pressed into the service. The vessel
employed between Recife and the island, visits it twice during the
same period, and carries provisions, cloathing, and other articles to
the miserable beings, who are compelled to remain there, and for the
troops. I have conversed with persons who have resided upon it,
and the accounts I have heard of the enormities committed there,
are most horrible; crimes, punished capitally or severely in civilized
states, or which at least are held in general abhorrence, are here
practised, talked of, publicly acknowledged, without shame, and
without remorse. Strange it is, that the dreadful state of this place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
should have so long escaped the notice of the supreme Government
of Brazil. But the evil ends not here; the individuals who return
to Pernambuco, cannot shake off the remembrance of crimes which
have become familiar to them. The powers, likewise, conceded to
the commandant, whose will is absolute, have oftentimes proved too
great for due performance; punishment seldom follows. The most
wanton tyranny may be practised almost without fear of retribution.
The climate of the island is good, and the small portion of it
admitting of cultivation, I have understood, from competent authority,
to be of extraordinary fertility. It does not, however, afford
any shelter for shipping.</p>

<p>The supineness of the ancient system upon which Brazil was ruled,
is still too apparent throughout; but the removal of the Sovereign to
that country has roused many persons who had been long influenced by
habits of indolence, and has increased the activity of others who have
impatiently awaited a field for its display. The Brazilians feel of more
importance, their native soil now gives law to the mother country;
their spirit, long kept under severe subjection to ancient colonial
rules and regulations, has now had some opportunities of showing
itself,&mdash;has proved, that though of long suffering, and patient of endurance,
it does exist, and that if its possessors are not treated as
men instead of children, it will break forth, and rend asunder those
shackles to which they have forbearingly submitted. I hope, however,
most sincerely, that the supreme Government may see the necessity
of reformation, and that the people will not expect too much,
but consider that many hardships are preferable to a generation of
bloodshed, confusion, and misery.</p>

<p>Freedom of communication with other nations has already been of
service to the country, and the benefits which it imparts are daily
augmenting. This shoot from our European continent will ultimately
increase, and a plant will spring up, infinitely more important than
the branch from which it proceeded; and though the season of this
maturity is far distant, yet the rapidity of its advance or tardiness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
of its growth greatly depends upon the fostering care or indifferent
negligence of its rulers. Still, whatever the conduct of these
may be, its extent, its fertility, and other numerous advantages must,
in the course of time, give to it, that rank which it has a right to
claim among the great nations of the world.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<p class="pch">JOURNEY TO GOIANA.&mdash;JOURNEY FROM GOIANA TO PARAIBA, AND BACK TO
GOIANA.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">I HAD much desired to perform some considerable journey into the
less populous and less cultivated part of the country. The chief
engineer officer of Pernambuco had intended to visit all the fortresses
within his extensive district, and had kindly promised to permit me
to accompany him, but unfortunately his projected journey was
delayed from some cause connected with his place, until the following
season. As I did not know how soon I might be under the necessity
of returning to England, I could not postpone my views for
this length of time, and therefore made enquiries among my friends
and acquaintance, and discovered that the brother of a gentleman
resident at Goiana, was about to set off for that place, and would,
probably, from thence proceed further into the country, with some
object in view connected with trade. It was my intention to advance
as far as Seara. I applied to the governor for a passport, which
was immediately granted without any difficulty.</p>

<p>On the afternoon of the 19th October, 1810, some of my English
friends accompanied me to my cottage at the Cruz das Almas, that
they might be present at my departure, in the course of the ensuing
night. Senhor Feliz, my companion, arrived in the evening, bringing
with him his black guide, a freeman. Preparations were made
for proceeding upon our journey, and about one o’clock, as the moon
rose, we sallied forth. Senhor Feliz, myself, and my English
servant John on horseback, armed with swords and pistols; the black
guide also on horseback, without saddle or bridle, carrying a blunderbuss,
and driving on before him a baggage-horse, with a little mulatto
boy mounted between the panniers. My English friends cheered us as
we left the Cruz, and remained in my quarters, the command of which
I had given up to one of them during my absence. That part of the
road which we traversed by moon-light I had already passed over a
short time before, and subsequently from frequent travelling, my acquaintance
with it was such, that I might have become a guide
upon it.</p>

     <div class="caption"><p class="pc">Map of the Route</p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>We rode along a sandy path for three quarters of a league, until
we began to ascend a steep hill, of which the sides and the flat summit
are covered with large trees, and thick brushwood growing beneath
them. The hamlet of Beberibe stands at the foot of the corresponding
declivity; to this place several families resort in the
summer, and a small rivulet runs through it, of which the water is
most beautifully clear. Half a league beyond Beberibe we crossed
another rivulet, and immediately afterwards commenced our ascent
of the hill of Quebracu, which is in most parts very steep and very
narrow, being inclosed on one side by a precipice, and on the other
by sloping ground covered with wood. This ridge of hill is quite
flat along the top, and the path continues for half a league, between
lofty trees and impenetrable brushwood. We descended into the
long and narrow valley of Merueira, through which a rivulet
runs, of which the water never fails. The hills on each side are
thickly cloathed with wood, and in the valley are scattered several
cottages, banana gardens, and mandioc lands, with a large inclosed
piece of ground in which cattle graze. The ascent, on the opposite
side of this beautiful vale, is very steep; the path along the summit
of the ridge is similar to that over which we had travelled; we
soon again descended, and on our arrival at the bottom, entered
the long, straggling village of Paratibe, with mandioc lands and
plaintain and tobacco gardens intermixed with the houses. The inhabitants
are mostly labouring free persons, white, mulatto, and black.
The houses are built on each side of the road at intervals, for the distance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
of one mile. A rivulet runs through it, which in the rainy
season often overflows its banks to a considerable distance on each
side. Beyond this village the road is comparatively flat, but is still
diversified by unequal small elevations; several sugar-works are seen,
and great numbers of small cottages; the passing of the country
people with loaded horses, carrying cotton, hides, and other articles,
the produce of the country, and returning with many kinds of wares,
salt meat and fish from Recife, may almost be called continual.</p>

<p>The town of Iguaraçu, which we now entered, has been already
mentioned in a former chapter; it is one of the oldest settlements
upon this part of the coast, and stands at the distance of two leagues
from the sea upon the banks of a creek. The woods, that border the
paths or roads, are in parts so thick and close as to be impassable even
to a man on foot, unless he carries in his hand a bill-hook or hatchet
to assist in breaking through the numberless obstacles which oppose
his progress. Of these the most formidable is the <i>cipo</i>; a plant consisting
of long and flexible shoots which twist themselves around the
trees, and as some of the sprouts, which have not yet fixed upon
any branch, are moved to and fro by the wind, they catch upon a
neighbouring tree, and as the operation continues for many years
undisturbed, a kind of net-work is made of irregular form, but difficult
to pass through. Of this plant there are several varieties; that
which bears the name of <i>cipo cururu</i> is in the highest estimation,
from its superior size and strength, and likewise from its great
flexibility. Several kinds of <i>cipo</i> are used as cordage in making
fences, and for many other purposes.</p>

<p>Iguaraçu is partly situated upon a hill and partly in the plain below,
where a rivulet runs, and a stone bridge has been built, as the tide
reaches this spot, and would render the communication difficult<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>.
The place plainly denotes that it has enjoyed greater prosperity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
than it at present has to boast of; many of the houses are of two
stories, but they are neglected, and some of the small cottages
are in decay and ruin. The streets are paved, but are much out of
repair, and grass grows in many of them. It contains several churches,
one convent, and a <i>recolhimento</i> or retreat for females, a town hall,
and prison. Its affluence proceeded formerly from the weekly cattle
fair, which was held upon a plain in the vicinity, but this has now
for some years past been removed to the neighbourhood of Goiana.
Iguaraçu has many white inhabitants, several shops, a good surgeon,
who was educated in Lisbon, and it is the resort of the plantations, to
the distance of several leagues, for the embarkation of their sugar
chests, and for the purchase of some articles of necessity. The town
contains about eight hundred inhabitants reckoning the scattered cottages
in the outskirts. The view from the tower of the principal
church is said to be extensive and grand. The only regular inn
of which the country has to boast is established here, for the
convenience of passengers between Recife and Goiana, and at this we
intended to have stopped had not the early hour at which we reached
it, tempted us to push forwards before the sun became more powerful.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>The road continues flat and sandy, and two leagues beyond Iguaraçu
we entered the village of Pasmado, which is built in the form
of a square; it consists of a church and a number of cottages, most of
them of mean appearance, containing from 300 to 400 inhabitants.
We proceeded through it, crossed the most considerable stream we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
had yet seen this day, called Araripe, and entered the inclosed
field attached to the <i>engenho</i>, or sugar-works, of Araripe de Baixo,
belonging to a Portugueze. We expected to have obtained a dinner
from this good man, but after considerable delay, to the great discomfort
of our stomachs, we understood from our host, that his intended
hospitality would not be in readiness, until the day would
have been too much broken into by the additional delay; therefore
we again mounted our horses about two o’clock, with a broiling sun,
ascended another steep hill, passed several sugar-works and cottages,
and crossed several rivulets, traversing a most delightful country.
We rode through the hamlets of Bû and Fontainhas, at the former
of which there is a chapel. From the latter the road is chiefly over
a sandy plain, almost without wood, until the <i>engenho</i> of Bujiri is
discovered with its field of grass and woods around. Immediately
beyond it is to be forded the river of Goiana, influenced by the tide
as far as this spot. The wooden bridge which formerly existed was
now fast decaying and dangerous for horses; we gave ours to the
guide, who led them through the water, riding upon his own, whilst
we found our way across some loose beams. This operation did
not delay us long; we received our steeds from the guide, with
their saddles wet and themselves all dripping, and in a few minutes
more entered the town of Goiana, between four and five o’clock
in the afternoon. The distance from Recife to Goiana is fifteen
leagues.</p>

<p>The road we had travelled over is the highway from the Sertam<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>,
by which the cattle descend from the estates upon the river
Açu, and from the plains of this portion of the interior to the markets
of Recife; therefore the continued passing of large droves of
cattle has beat down the underwood and made a broad sandy road;
the large trees still remain, if it has so happened that any grew upon
the track; these, if of any size, brave the crowd of animals, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
will remain either until they decay from age and fall, or till regular
roads begin to be constructed in Brazil. Thus, if the ground is flat,
the road is not bad; but upon the sides of hills, instead of being carried
round the steepest ascents, the track has been made straight up
and down or nearly so, and the winter torrents form deep caverns
and ravines, the sides of which sometimes fall in and make the roads
very dangerous; so that, unless well acquainted with a hill, it is by
no means safe to ascend or descend by night, as one or two days of
the usual rain of Brazil may have made a great difference, and
have rendered the road impassable. In the course of this day we saw
four or five large and rudely constructed crosses erected by the road
side, pointing out the situations upon which murder had been committed.</p>

<p>I was received most kindly by Senhor Joaquim, whom I had before
had the pleasure of meeting at Recife, and he was not a man to be
long in becoming acquainted with. We sat down to dinner about
five o’clock, when his lady and two little girls, his daughters, made
their appearance. We had dishes cooked in Portugueze, Brazilian,
and English style.</p>

<p>The town of Goiana, one of the largest and most flourishing in the
captaincy of Pernambuco, is situated upon the banks of a river of the
same name, which at this spot bends so considerably, that the town
is almost surrounded by it. The dwellings, with one or two exceptions,
have only the ground-floor; the streets are not paved, but are
broad, and of these the principal one is of sufficient breadth to
admit of a large church at one extremity, and the continuation of
a street of considerable width on each side of the church. The
town contains a Carmelite convent, and several other places of worship.
The inhabitants are in number between four and five thousand,
and it is an increasing place. Several shops are established here,
and the commerce with the interior is considerable. In the streets
are always to be seen numbers of the <i>matutos</i><a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>, countrymen, either<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
selling produce or purchasing manufactured goods and other articles
of consumption. In the vicinity are many fine sugar plantations.
I suppose that some of the best lands in the province are in this
neighbourhood. The proprietors of these occasionally reside in
the town, and as daily intercourse often creates rivalry among
wealthy families, this necessarily increases expenditure, and the
town is in consequence much benefited by the augmented consumption
of luxuries. The planters have the advantage of water carriage
from hence to Recife for their sugar-chests, as this river is one of the
largest for many leagues to the north or to the south, and is influenced
by the tide even to a short distance above the town. Goiana stands
four leagues distant from the sea in a direct line, but by the river
it is reckoned to be seven. Above the town in the rainy season the
river overflows its banks to a great extent.</p>

<p>Goiana and its extensive district is subject in military affairs to the
governor of Pernambuco, but its civil concerns are directed by a <i>Juiz
de Fora</i>, a judicial officer appointed by the supreme government for
the term of three years, who resides in the town, and from his decisions
appeal may be made to the <i>Ouvidor</i> of Paraiba.</p>

<p>We dined on one occasion with the proprietor of the Musumbu
estate; this gentleman and a few others, besides ourselves, dined in
one apartment, whilst the ladies, of whom we were not permitted
even to have a transient view, were in another adjoining. Two young
men, sons of the proprietor, assisted their father’s slaves in waiting
upon us at dinner, and did not sit down themselves until we rose
from table. The owner of the place is a Portugueze&mdash;it is among
this portion of the population, who have left their own country to
accumulate fortunes in Brazil, that the introduction of improvement
is almost impossible. Many Brazilians likewise, even of the higher
class, follow the Moorish customs of subjection and seclusion, but
these soon see the preference which ought to be given to more civilized
manners and easily enter into more polished habits, if they have
any communication with the towns.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>On the 24th of October, I delivered a letter of introduction which
I had obtained at Recife, to the Dr. Manuel Arruda da Camara. This
interesting person then lay at Goiana very ill of dropsy, brought on
by residing in aguish districts. He was an enterprising man, and had
always been an enthusiast in botany. His superior abilities would have
caused him to be caressed by a provident Government, when one of this
description is establishing itself in an uncultivated but improving
country. He shewed me some of his drawings, which I thought well
executed. I never again had an opportunity of seeing him; for when
I returned from Seara, I had not time to enquire and seek for him, and
he died before my second voyage to Pernambuco. He was forming a
Flora Pernambucana, which he did not live to complete.</p>

<p>Senhor Joaquim had business at Paraiba, which he intended to have
sent his brother Feliz to transact; but as I offered to accompany
him, he thought it would be pleasant to go with me, and show the
lions of that city. We sent off his black guide and my servant with
a loaded horse before us, and followed the next day with his black
boy. We crossed the <i>Campinas de Goiana Grande</i> about sunrise,
and passed the sugar plantation of that name, belonging to Senhor
Giram, standing at the foot of the hill, which carries you to the Dous
Rios. The road I afterwards followed to Rio Grande, is through
Dous Rios, but the road to Paraiba strikes off just before you reach
it, to the right. The road between Goiana and Paraiba presents
nothing particularly interesting,&mdash;the hills are steep but not high,
and woods, plantations, and cottages are, as usual, the objects to be
seen. The distance is thirteen leagues. We entered the city of
Paraiba at twelve o’clock, and rode to the house of the colonel
Mattias da Gama, a man of property, and a colonel of militia. He
was an acquaintance of Senhor Joaquim, and was about to leave the
place for one of his sugar plantations, which he did, giving us entire
possession of his house, and a servant to attend upon us.</p>

<p>The city of Paraiba, (for much smaller places even than this bear
the rank of city in these yet thinly peopled regions) contains from
two to three thousand inhabitants, including the lower town. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
bears strong marks of having been a place of more importance than
it is now, and though some improvements were going on, they
were conducted entirely through the means which Government supplied
for them, or rather, the Governor wished to leave some memorial
of his administration of the province. The principal street is
broad, and paved with large stones, but is somewhat out of repair.
The houses are mostly of one story, with the ground floors as
shops, and a few of them have glass windows; an improvement which
has been only lately introduced into Recife. The Jesuit’s convent
is employed as the governor’s palace, and the <i>Ouvidor</i>’s office
and residence also; the church of the convent stands in the centre,
and these are the two wings. The convents of the Franciscan, Carmelite,
and Benedictine Orders are very large buildings, and are
almost uninhabited; the first contains four or five friars, the second
two, and the third only one. Besides these, the city has to boast of six
churches. The public fountains at Paraiba are the only works of
the kind I met with any where on the part of the coast which I
visited. One was built, I believe, by Amaro Joaquim, the former
governor,&mdash;it is handsome, and has several spouts; the other,
which was only then building, is much larger, and the superintendance
of the workmen was the chief amusement of the governor.</p>

<p>We waited upon this gentleman the day after our arrival; my
companion had been acquainted with him in Lisbon, when he was
an ensign. His parents were respectable people in one of the
northern provinces of Portugal; he was placed at some seminary for
the purpose of being educated for the church, but he escaped from
thence, and enlisted as a private soldier in Lisbon. One of the
officers of the regiment in which he was enrolled, soon found out that
he was a man of education,&mdash;having learnt his story, he was made a
cadet, as being of good family. He came over in the same ship with
the Princess of Brazil, a captain of infantry; married one of the
maids of honour on their arrival at Rio de Janeiro, and in about
eighteen months, had advanced from a captaincy to the government of
Paraiba, and a commandery of the Order of Christ. We next crossed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
to the other wing of the building, and paid a visit to the <i>Ouvidor</i>, a
very affable and good-humoured old gentleman. His chaplain, a jolly
little friar, and an old acquaintance of Senhor Joaquim, made his appearance,
and was afterwards very civil to us during our stay. The
prospect from the windows presents Brazil scenery of the best kind;
extensive and evergreen woods, bounded by a range of hills, and
watered by several branches of the river, with here and there a white
washed cottage, placed upon their banks, and these, though they were
situated on higher spots of land, were still half concealed by the lofty
trees. The cultivated specks were so small, as to be scarcely perceptible.</p>

<p>The lower town consists of small houses, and is situated upon the
borders of a spacious basin or lake, formed by the junction of three
rivers, which from hence discharge their waters into the sea, by one
considerable stream. The banks of the basin are covered with mangroves,
as in all the salt water rivers of this country; and they are so
close and thick, that there seems to be no outlet. I did not follow
the river down to the sea, but I understand that there are in it some
fine islands, with good land, quite uncultivated<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>. Paraiba was the
scene of much fighting during the Dutch war, and I now regret not
having proceeded down the river, to the famous Fort of Cabedello.
This war was conducted upon a small scale, but the deeds which
were performed by the brave defenders of their country, may rank
with those which any other people have displayed in a cause of equal
import to the actors.</p>

<p>The trade of Paraiba is inconsiderable, though the river admits of
vessels of 150 tons upon the bar; and when in the basin, opposite to
the lower town, a rope yarn would keep them still, as no harm could
reach them. It contains a regular custom-house, which is seldom
opened. Paraiba lies out of the road from the Sertam<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> to Recife,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
that is, out of the direct way from the towns upon the coast further
north. The inhabitants of the Sertam of the interior, will make for
Recife rather than Paraiba, as the more extensive market for their produce.
The port of Recife admits of larger vessels, and has more conveniences
for the landing and shipment of goods, consequently it obtains
the preference. The houses of this place, which may be reckoned
handsome from a general comparison of the country, have been built
by the great landholders in the neighbourhood, as a residence during
the depth of the winter, or rainy season. The lands of the captaincy
are, generally speaking, rich and fertile, but so great a preference
is given to plantations nearer to Recife, that those of Paraiba
are to be purchased at a much less price. The sugar of this province
is reckoned equal to that of any part of Brazil.</p>

<p>I soon saw what was to be seen, and we had no society; time,
however, did not appear to hang heavy, for Senhor Joaquim was a
man of inexhaustible good humour and hilarity. We lived by
magic, as the colonel had ordered his servant to supply every thing
for us.</p>

<p>The late governor, Amaro Joaquim, brought the captaincy into
great order, by his necessary severity. A custom prevailed, of persons
walking about the town at night in large cloaks, and crape over
their faces; thus concealed, to carry on their irregular practices.
The governor, not being able to discover who these persons were, gave
orders one night for the patrole to take into custody all who were so
dressed; this was done, and some of the principal inhabitants were
found the next morning in the guard-house. A man of the name of
Nogueira, the son of a black or mulatto woman, and of one of the first
men in the captaincy, had made himself much dreaded by his outrageous
proceedings; he had carried from their parents’ houses, the daughters
of some persons of respectability in the captaincy, murdering the
friends and relatives who opposed his entrance. The man was at last
taken; Amaro Joaquim would have had him executed, but he found
this was not to be done, from the interest which the family made for
him, and therefore ordered him to be flogged. Nogueira said, that
being half a <i>fidalgo</i>, a nobleman, this mode of punishment could not be
practised upon him. The governor then ordered that he should be
flogged upon only one side of his body, that his <i>fidalgo</i> side might not
suffer, desiring Nogueira to say which was his <i>fidalgo</i> side. He was
accordingly punished in this manner, and after remaining some time
in prison, was sent to Angola for life. The city of Paraiba
still enjoyed the good effects of Amaro Joaquim’s strict government.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>I was acquainted with him at Pernambuco, before I set off on this
journey; his appearance and his conversation both bespoke a man of
superior abilities. When I saw him in Recife, he was on his way to
Piauhi, of which captaincy he had been appointed governor. He
died on board a coasting vessel, on the passage to Piauhi, of a
fever.</p>

<p>Senhor Joaquim wished to return by the sea shore to Goiana, a
distance of twenty-two leagues. We set off at the time the tide was
flowing, and proceeded along the beach, until about eleven o’clock
we reached the house of a <i>Capitam-mor</i>, quite a first rate man in this
part of the world. It was a mud cottage, as bad or worse than that
of any labourer in England, situated upon the burning sands, with a
pool of salt water before the door, which is never quite dry, consequently,
breeds insects of all kinds. We crossed two ferries in the
course of the morning; the conveyances are small <i>jangadas</i><a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>; the
saddle is placed upon it, and the horse swims by the side, whilst the
rider stands upon the raft, and holds the reins. The ferryman either
paddles across the stream, or poles, if it be not too deep. About
three o’clock, we found that we had entered upon a considerable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
track of sand, inclosed by perpendicular rocks, against which the
water mark was at some height, however, the tide was already on
the ebb; we made our guide mount the horse, which until now he had
driven before him, and keep pace with us, whilst we quickened ours.
The tide was still very near to the rocks, and we found that the
water still reached one which projected further than the rest, therefore
as we were yet hemmed in, we left our horses, and climbed up
this rock. The guide, in the mean time, drove the loose horses into
the water, they fortunately leaned to the right, passed out far
enough to see the land on the other side of the rock, and made for it.
I was getting over the rock, missed my footing, and fell up to my
arms into a hole between two pieces of it; however, I succeeded in
raising myself, and leaped from it on to the sand on the other side,
just at the return of a wave, by which means I had an unintentional
cold bath up to my waist. We might certainly have waited to have
allowed the tide to retreat, but were afraid of being benighted, which
after all our exertions, did happen to us. The country, on the other
side of the projecting rock, is low, and sandy uncultivated land. At
dusk, we arrived upon the banks of a broad stream, so that by
the light which then remained, we could not see the other side; after
several calls, the ferryman did not make his appearance, and the
night closed in. I advised sleeping under the tree which then sheltered
us; to this my companion would not consent, but asked the
distance to Abia, the nearest sugar plantation; the guide answered
three leagues,&mdash;we must either sleep where we were, or go to Abia.
We had already advanced sixteen leagues, and Senhor Joaquim’s
horse, a fine highly fed animal, began to give way. The guide
led, and we followed, through a narrow path, very little frequented,
as the bushes oftentimes nearly took off our hats, and were
continually brushing against us the whole way. On our arrival at
Abia, the house was quite deserted, as the steward was from home,
and we did not like to enter a cottage which stood near to the principal
house, when we found that the party in it was larger than our
own, and not likely to be of the best kind. We had now another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
half league to go to Senhor Leonardo’s, a friend of my fellow-traveller.</p>

<p>He gave us a good supper, and hammocks, took good care of our
horses, and in the morning we set forth for Goiana, seven leagues.
We passed through Alhandra, an Indian village, containing about six
hundred inhabitants. This village is not so regularly built as many
of the others which I have seen; instead of a square, with houses
on each side, it is built in streets, and though the square is
preserved, still it is not the principal feature of the place. The
Indians of Alhandra, from their vicinity to Goiana, which is distant
about three leagues, are not so pure as those further from a large
town; they have admitted among them some <i>mamalucos</i> and
<i>mestizos</i>.</p>

<p>Great part of this extent of coast was uninhabited, but wherever
the land was low, and the surf not violent, there we found a few
cottages; the banks of the rivers were also not entirely destitute of
inhabitants. The two streams which we first crossed might be about
eighty or one hundred yards in breadth; they are deep, but do
not proceed far into the country. When the action of the tide ceases,
all these lesser streams become insignificant, and most of them
quite dry. The great river which we were to have crossed is the
Goiana; it spreads very widely when the tide enters, but is easily
passed at the ebb, and the channel becomes much contracted, and
very shallow during the spring tides. It is judged to be about a league
in breadth, at its mouth, and is much deeper immediately within
the bar than upon it.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER V.</h2>

<p class="pch">JOURNEY FROM GOIANA TO RIO GRANDE.&mdash;THE CITY OF NATAL.&mdash;THE
GOVERNOR.</p>


<p class="drop-cap">I HAD entertained hopes of being accompanied by Senhor Joaquim,
at least as far as Rio Grande, but he changed his mind, and I
began to make the necessary arrangements for going alone. I purchased
three more horses, and hired a guide for the Sertam, who was
a white man of the country, and two Indian lads of about sixteen years
of age. On the 3d November, I again set forth, accompanied by my
English John, Francisco the guide, Julio, and the other boy, his
companion. We only reached Dous Rios the same evening, which is
two leagues distant from Goiana; we had left that place late in the day,
and got on very slowly, as the two loads upon the horses were not
well divided and arranged. I now found, on stopping for the night,
that I had not provided as many things as were necessary; that I
wanted an additional piece of baize to cover myself at night, that we
ought to have brought more kitchen apparatus, and that knives and
forks were to be had very rarely. I had with me a trunk with my
cloaths, on one side of the pack-saddle, and a case, with some bottles
of rum and wine, on the other side, and my hammock in the middle;
these made one load. The other horse carried in the <i>malas</i>, a kind
of trunk, on the one side, our provisions, and on the other, the
cloaths of my people, additional ropes, and other tackle. I was far
from being well supplied, but afterwards provided myself with more
things as I went on, learning by experience. The hammocks are all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
made of cotton, and are of several sizes and colours, and of various
workmanship. Those in use among the lower orders, are made of
cotton cloth, of the manufacture of the country; others are composed
of net-work, from which all the several kinds derive the general
name of <i>Rede</i>, a net; others, again, are knit or woven in long straight
threads, knotted across at intervals: these are usually dyed of two
or three colours, and are to be found in the houses of wealthy persons.
This species of bed has been adopted from the Indians, and nothing
more convenient and better adapted to the climate, could possibly
be imagined; it can be wrapped up into a very small compass, and,
with the addition of a piece of baize as a coverlid, is usually of sufficient
warmth.</p>

<p>I could not discover that there was any stream at this place, though
it bears the name of Dous Rios, or the two rivers. It is a large open
piece of land, with cottages upon the skirts, and attached to each is a
pen for cattle. The great weekly fair for cattle from the Sertam, for
the Pernambuco market, is held here.</p>

<p>From Dous Rios, we advanced the following day to the sugar plantation
of Espirito Santo, situated upon the banks of the river Paraiba,
which becomes dry in the summer, at a short distance above this
estate. I had letters to the owner of it, who is a member of the
Cavalcante family, and the Capitam-mor of the captaincy of Paraiba.
I was received by him in a very friendly manner. The house is in
the usual style of the country, having only the ground-floor, and no
ceiling, the tiles and rafters being in full view. Supper of dried meat,
and the flour of the mandioc made into paste, and called <i>piram</i>, was
placed before me; also, some hard biscuits, and red wine. I was
not then sufficiently a Brazilian to eat <i>piram</i>, and took the biscuits
with the meat in preference, which much astonished my host.
Sweetmeats were afterwards brought in, which are always good in
the houses of persons of his rank in life; the opulent people in
Brazil taking as much pride in their <i>doces</i>, as an English citizen in
his table or his wines. The cloth was laid at one end of a long table,
and I sat down by myself, whilst the Capitam-mor placed himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
upon the table, near to the other end, and talked to me; and some
of the chief persons of his establishment stood around, to see the
strange animal called an Englishman. We adjourned from the supper-room
into another spacious apartment, and each of us took a
hammock, of which there were several in the room, and swung and
talked until we were half asleep. One of his men supposed, that as
I spoke Portugueze, either I must be an Englishman who did not
speak English, or that any Portugueze, on going to England, would
immediately speak the language of that country, as I did Portugueze.
The Capitam-mor seldom leaves his estate to go to Recife,
or even to Paraiba, and lives in the usual style of the Brazilian
gentry, in a kind of feudal state. He had several young men about
him, some of whom were employed by him; neither his wife, nor
any of his children appeared. The principal apartments of this
house are two spacious rooms, having a great number of doors
and windows; in one, were several hammocks and a sofa; and in the
other, the long table upon which I supped; there were a few chairs in
each of them; the floors were of brick, and the shutters and doors
were unpainted. The owner of this mansion wore a shirt and a pair
of drawers, a long bed-gown, called a <i>chambre</i>, and a pair of slippers.
This is the usual dress of those persons who have no work to perform.
When a Brazilian takes to wearing one of these long gowns, he
begins to think himself a gentleman, and entitled, consequently, to
much respect.</p>

<p>The next day we advanced about seven leagues, and, for the first
time, I slept in the open air. We intended to have taken up our
lodging for the night at a neighbouring hamlet, but the huts were so
small and miserable, being constructed of the leaves of palm trees,
that I preferred the open air. We made for the rivulet which
runs at a little distance from these habitations; the horses were immediately
unloaded, and their pack-saddles taken off, that they might
roll in comfort. The next thing to be done, was to get firewood,&mdash;in
most parts of the country it is very plentiful, and as we were upon
the skirts of a thick wood, there was here no want of it. A light<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
was struck, and two fires made; we got an additional pan from
one of the neighbouring huts, and our dried meat was cooked. The
meat is dried in the old Indian manner, by laying it upon a platform
of twigs, raised about eighteen inches from the ground, and making
a fire underneath. We discovered that not far off, a field or piece
of land, rather more cleared of wood than the rest, was rented by a
cottager, who would allow our horses to be put into it for a <i>vintem</i>,
about five farthings each, for the night, which the guide thought I
should consider dear, and therefore told me, it was the usual price.
As may be supposed, I made no great difficulties on this score,
and the horses were taken to the place by Julio, and his companion.
I now thought myself settled for the night, and therefore ate my
supper, sitting in my hammock, which was slung between two trees,
with the plate upon one of the trunks; having finished, I took my
segar, and sat down close to the fire; the guide lighted his pipe, and
placed himself on the opposite side, that we might have a talk about
our proceedings for the morrow. I returned to my hammock about
ten o’clock, but found the air very sharp, and consequently laid down
under the lee of the fire, upon a hide, of which we had two for covering
the loads in case of rain.</p>

<p>This was to me a new scene,&mdash;when I thought of the complete
change of habits which this kind of life required, and how entirely
different it was from any thing in England, I may almost say in
Europe,&mdash;when I looked round, and saw our several fires, for the
cold air had, by this time, obliged each person to have his own; the
men all asleep, our pack-saddles, trunks, and other parts of our baggage
scattered about, as it was taken from the horses,&mdash;when I heard
the running of the water, and the rustling of the trees; and, when I
considered, that I was entering among a people with whose habits I
was little acquainted, whose feelings towards my countrymen I was
ignorant of,&mdash;I felt a kind of damp; but this was soon removed, by
thinking of the pleasure of return, and of the accomplishment of
what I was deemed incapable of performing. I was cheered by my
recollection of the knowledge I had of the language, and by the determination<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
I felt within me of conforming to the customs of the
people,&mdash;of submitting to their prejudices. I was not old enough to
have contracted any habits, too deep to be laid aside when necessary.
These thoughts were interrupted by the cry of “Jezus,” which was
repeated every half minute in a dismal voice; I called to the guide,
supposing it to proceed from some person in distress; he waked, and I
told him what had made me call to him,&mdash;he said, it was only
some person helping another “<i>a bem morrer</i>,” that is, that some dying
person, which I found was the usual custom, had a friend to repeat
the word “Jezus,” until the sufferer expired, that it might not be forgotten,
and, perhaps, to keep the devil off.</p>

<p>I dined the following day at the village of Mamanguape, situated
upon the banks of a dry river; it is a thriving place. These more
modern villages have been built in one long street upon the road, the
older ones in a square. It had then about three hundred inhabitants;
but I have since heard, that the number is more than doubled, and
that new houses are building. The river can scarcely be reckoned of
any advantage to the village, but the place forms a convenient break
between Goiana and Rio Grande for the travelling pedlars, a useful,
industrious, and, generally, honest set of men, as their resting-place
and head-quarters; from hence they make daily excursions to
the plantations, at a little distance, and return here to sleep. I passed
the night in the out-houses of some sugar-works; my guide was much
astonished at my not asking for lodgings at the <i>caza-grande</i>, or
owner’s house; but I preferred these kind of quarters to better ones,
where I might run the risk of being obliged to remain half the night
awake, for the purpose of giving news. The hospitality, however,
of the planters, is very great; and no recommendation is necessary,
though I had provided myself with a few letters.</p>

<p>The next day we proceeded to Cunhàû, the sugar-plantation of
the Colonel Andre d’Albuquerque do Maranham, the chief of the
Maranham branch of this numerous and distinguished family
of the Albuquerques. He is a man of immense landed property.
The plantation of Cunhàû extends along the road fourteen leagues,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
and the owner has since purchased another large estate adjoining;
his lands likewise in the Sertam for breeding cattle are supposed not
to be less than thirty to forty leagues in extent&mdash;of those kind of
leagues that sometimes take a man three or four hours to get
over one.</p>

<p>I had letters to him from some of his relations and friends at
Pernambuco; he was sitting at his door, with his chaplain and several
of his stewards and other persons employed by him, to have all
the benefit of the fresh air. He is a man of about thirty years
of age, handsome, and rather above the middle size, with genteel
manners, rather courtly, as the Brazilians of education generally
are. He lives quite in feudal state; his negroes and other
dependants are numerous. He commands the regiment of militia
cavalry of Rio Grande, and has them in good order, considering
the state of the country. He came forwards on my dismounting,
and I gave him the letters, which he put by to read at leisure, and
then desiring me to sit down, asked me several questions of my wishes,
intentions, &amp;c. He took me to his guests’ apartments at a little distance
from his own residence, where I found a good bed; hot water
was brought to me in a large brass basin, and every necessary was
supplied in a magnificent style&mdash;the towels were all fringed, &amp;c.
When I had dressed myself, I expected to be called to supper, but,
to my amazement, I waited until near one o’clock, when a servant
came to summon me. I found in the dining-room a long table laid
out and covered with meat of several kinds, and in quantity sufficient
for twenty persons; to this feast the colonel, his chaplain, another
person, and myself sat down; when I had tasted until I was quite
tired, to my utter dismay another course came on, equally profuse of
fowls, pastry, &amp;c. &amp;c. and when this was removed, I had yet a third
to go through of at least ten different kinds of sweetmeats. The
supper could not have been better cooked or handsomer, if it had
been prepared at Recife, and even an English epicure might have
found much to please his palate. I was not able to retire to rest
until near three o’clock; my bed was most excellent, and I enjoyed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
it still more from not expecting to find one. In the morning, the
colonel would not allow me to leave his house, until I had breakfasted;
tea, coffee, and cakes were brought in, all of which were
very good. He then took me to see his horses, and pressed me
much to leave my own, and take one of his for my journey, that
mine might be in good condition on my return, and he also urged
me to leave my pack-horses, and take some of his; but as mine were
still all in working order, I declined accepting his offer. These circumstances
are mentioned to show the frankness with which strangers
are treated. I could not get away before ten o’clock, and therefore
only advanced two leagues to dinner; I stopped by the side of a
rivulet under some trees, upon a most beautiful spot.</p>

<p>At a short distance from the estate of Cunhàû, is a hamlet of
the same name through which I passed in my way to the colonel’s
plantation. This hamlet, or the estate itself, was the scene of a massacre,
which was committed by the Pitagoares and Tapuyas from the
Potengi in the year 1645. A battle was fought by Camaram, the
Indian chieftain, to whose prowess the Portugueze are so much indebted,
against the Dutch, in the following year, between Cunhàû
and Fort Keulen which stands at the mouth of the Potengi.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>The captaincy of Rio Grande commences some leagues to the
southward of Cunhàû, at a place called Os Marcos&mdash;a deep dell inhabited
by runaway negroes and criminals; the paths of the dell are
intricate, and when once a man has taken up his residence here, it is
impossible to dislodge him.</p>

<p>This season the crop of cotton had failed; it was one of those
years in which a great want of rain was felt. The colonel of Cunhàû
had, for the first time, planted a piece of land, from which he expected
to have gathered 10,000 <i>arrobas</i>, but in the end only gathered about
100; and he told me that he should keep to his sugar henceforwards.
He is lenient to his slaves; they looked fat and well, and he has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
the character of not making as much of his plantation as he might,
which is one proof of his kindness to them. The estate of Cunhàû
is one of the largest, if not quite the most extensive, in these
parts. There are upon it about 150 negroes, and the lands belonging
to it would employ four or five times the number, but the colonel
pays more attention to cattle, by which his father increased his fortune
very largely.</p>

<p>As usual, on our arrival by the side of the rivulet the horses were
unloaded, and my hammock was slung for me. I laid down in
my cloaths, but soon I started up, finding myself uneasy. The
guide saw me, and called out, “O sir, you are covered with <i>carapatos</i>.”
I then perceived them, and felt still more their bites. Instantly
throwing off part of my cloaths, but with the remainder upon
me I ran into the water, and there began to take them off. The <i>carapato</i>
or tick, is a small, flat insect, of a dark brown colour; about the
size of four pins’ heads placed together, it fastens upon the skin, and
will in time eat its way into it. It is dangerous to pull it out
quickly, when already fixed, for if the head remains, inflammation is
not unfrequently the consequence. The point of a heated fork or penknife
applied to the insect, when it is too far advanced into the skin
to be taken out with the hand, will succeed in loosening it. There
is another species of tick of much larger size, and of a lead colour;
this is principally troublesome to horses and horned cattle, that are
allowed to run loose in lands which have been only partially cleared. I
have, in some instances, seen horses that have had such vast numbers
upon them, as to have been weakened by the loss of blood which they
have occasioned. The insects of this species of <i>carapato</i><a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> fasten themselves
to the skin, but do not force their way into it. The hammock
had fallen to the ground accidentally when taken from the trunk to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
be slung, and had thus picked up these unpleasant visitors. I had
some trouble in getting them all off, but was successful, as I had attacked
the enemy in time.</p>

<p>We set off again about two o’clock; I had intended to have ridden
until sunset, and then to have put up near to some cottage, but a
young man overtook us, and we entered into conversation. He lived
at Papari, a village about half a league out of the road, and he pressed
me so much to accompany him to sleep at his place, that I agreed.
Papari is a deep and narrow valley, a most delightful situation. The
whole of the valley is cultivated, and principally this year, the lands
were in great request, as the rains had failed, and the high sandy
lands had proved barren. For, whilst every other part of the country
appeared dry and burnt up, this spot was in full verdure&mdash;it
appeared to laugh at all around it, aware of its own superiority.
The inhabitants seemed by their countenances to partake of the joyful
looks of the land they lived in. Papari yet enjoys another advantage;
though it is at the distance of three or four leagues from
the sea, a salt water lake reaches it, so that its inhabitants have the
fish brought to their own doors. The tide enters the lake, which
is never dry, for although the fresh springs which run into it might
fail, still it would always preserve a certain portion of water from the
sea. The fishermen come up upon their small river <i>jangadas</i>, which
do not require more than twelve inches of water. Papari is about
five leagues from Cunhàû. Senhor Dionisio introduced me to his
lady; he is a native of Portugal, and she a Brazilian. They possessed
a small piece of land in the valley, and appeared to be comfortably
situated. Papari may contain about three hundred inhabitants very
much scattered. In the course of this year, I afterwards heard, that
many persons flocked to it from other parts, owing to the absolute
want of provisions. I went down to the edge of the lake to see the
fishermen arrive, the people of the valley had all assembled to receive
them; it was quite a Billingsgate in miniature&mdash;save that the Portugueze
language does not admit of swearing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>We dined in Brazilian style, upon a table raised about six inches
from the ground, around which we sat or rather laid down upon mats;
we had no forks, and the knives, of which there were two or three,
were intended merely to sever the larger pieces of meat&mdash;the fingers
were to do the rest. I remained at Papari during one entire day,
that my horses might have some respite, that I might purchase another
from Senhor Dionisio, and on poor Julio’s account, whose feet
had begun to crack from the dryness of the sands.</p>

<p>Distant from Papari, from three to four leagues, is the Indian village
of St. Joze, built in the form of a square; this place might contain
about two hundred inhabitants, but it had evidently the appearance
of falling to decay; the grass in the centre of the square
was high, the church neglected, and the whole aspect dull. St. Joze
stands upon a dry sandy soil, and the severity of the season might
have contributed to its dismal look. This day we experienced the
utter impossibility of trusting to the accounts we received of distances,
and my guide had no very clever head for recollecting them,
although he, like most of these people, possessed a kind of instinct
with respect to the paths we were to follow. We were told that
Natal was distant from St. Joze three or four leagues, and therefore
expected to arrive at that place by dusk, but about five o’clock we
entered upon the dismal sand hills, over which lies the road to the
city; the whole country is uninhabited, and I may say uninhabitable,
between Natal and St. Joze, consequently we had very faint hopes of
meeting any one to give us information of the distance; but the guide
said he supposed we could not be nearer to it than from two to
three leagues, from the recollection he had of these hills, which
when once passed over cannot be entirely forgotten. When it was
nearly dark, and when our horses were almost giving way, we saw two
boys on horseback, coming towards us: we asked them the distance,
they answered “two leagues, and all deep sand,” adding, that
they belonged to a party, which had come to make <i>farinha</i>,
upon a spot of land, half a league distant from where we were,
upon which mandioc was cultivated. They said, that to go on to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
Rio Grande the same night was madness, that they were going
a short way to water their horses, and that on their return, they would
guide us to their party. I agreed to wait for them. When they
arrived, they struck soon from the road, down the side of one of the
hills,&mdash;it was now dark; we followed, entered some high and thick
brushwood, and a considerable way into it, found the persons to
whom the boys told us they belonged. The implements for making
the <i>farinha</i> were placed under a shed, which was thatched with the
leaves of the <i>macaiba</i>, and other palm trees. These persons had fixed
upon this spot, as there was a spring of brackish water hard by, which
was, however, only to be reached by descending a precipice; the
pitcher was fastened to a cord, and drawn up, and the person who
descended to fill it, ascended the precipice by means of the brushwood
which grows upon the side. I did not much like the party,
therefore we took up our lodgings at some little distance from them,
and none of us settled regularly for the night. I now much regretted
not having a dog with me. Our horses passed a wretched night,
feeding upon the leaves of the shrubs around us.</p>

<p>The next morning we continued our journey over the sand hills to
Natal, travelling at about two miles within the hour. The distance
from Goiana to Natal is fifty-five leagues. The sand
hills are perpetually changing their situations and forms; the high
winds blow the sand in clouds, which renders it dangerous to travellers;
it is white, and very fine, so that our horses sunk up to the knees at
every step,&mdash;painful to a very great degree, when the sun has had
full power upon it. Poor Julio had mounted upon the haunches of
one of the loaded horses, and occasioned our travelling still slower.
All was desolate and dreary; for the great lightness of the sand
almost prevented vegetation, though some of the creeping sea-side
plants had succeeded here and there in establishing a footing.</p>

<p>The track of country between Goiana and Espirito Santo, and
indeed even to Cunhàû, keeping at no great distance from the coast,
is appropriated for the most part to sugar-plantations; but many of
the Senhores de <i>Engenho</i>, sugar-planters, also employ part of their time
in raising cotton. The general feature is of an uncultivated country,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
though a great quantity of land is yearly employed. The
system of agriculture is so slovenly, or rather, as there is no
necessity for husbandry of land, from the immensity of the
country, and the smallness of its population, lands are employed
one year, and the next the brushwood is allowed to grow up,
giving thus to every piece of ground that is not absolutely in use
that year, the look of one totally untouched, until a person is acquainted,
in some measure, from practice, with the appearance of the
several kinds of land. He will then perceive the difference between
brushwood that will not grow because the land is of a barren kind,
and that which is left to rise, that the land may rest for another crop.
From this manner of cultivating their lands, a plantation requires
three or four times more ground than would otherwise be necessary.
I passed through several deep woods, and ascended some steep hills,
but I saw nothing which deserved the name of mountain; I crossed some
flat sandy plains, upon which the acaju, mangaba, and several species
of palm or cabbage trees grow; these are merely fit to turn cattle
upon in winter, and will only be brought into cultivation when
lands begin to be scarce in Brazil. <i>Varseas</i>, or low marshy lands,
adapted to the sugar cane, I also frequently saw. The <i>cercados</i>, or
fenced pieces of ground, attached to each sugar plantation, upon
which are fed the cattle kept for the work of it, are the only spots
which bear the look of fields; and even in these, the brushwood is
not always sufficiently cleared away, unless the proprietor is wealthy
and has an abundance of persons upon his estate; otherwise, such is
the fertility of the soil, that without great care, the <i>cercado</i> will
in time become a wood. There are several hamlets upon
the road, consisting of three and four cottages, and these are
built of slight timber, and the leaves of the cabbage trees; others
have mud walls, and are covered with these leaves; and now
and then, a house built of mud, with a tiled roof, is to be seen,&mdash;this
bespeaks a man above the common run of people. I crossed several
rivulets, which were much reduced by the drought; but I did
not see any great streams. The Paraiba was dry where I passed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
it, as also was the river near Mamanguape. A rivulet, that runs into
the lake at Papari, was the only stream which appeared still to possess
its usual strength. The road from Goiana to Mamanguape is the
great Sertam track, and is similar to that between Recife and Goiana,
excepting that the plains of the part of the country I had just now traversed,
are more extensive, and the roads over these are dangerous,
as they are only marked by the short and ill-grown grass being worn
away upon the path; but as the cattle extend more upon a plain, and
cannot be kept so close, from the greater extent of ground over
which they pass, each part receives fewer footsteps, and the grass
not unfrequently resists their passing, and vegetation still continues;
consequently, in an imperfect light, an experienced guide is necessary,
as on these plains no huts are ever to be met with, being,
for the most part, destitute of water. These, the Brazilians call
<i>taboleiros</i>, distinguishing them by this name, from <i>campinas</i>; upon
the latter, the soil is closer, and they afford good grass. Beyond
Mamanguape, the road is sometimes a mere path, with breadth sufficient
only for two loaded horses to pass, and, in some places, it has
not even the necessary width for this purpose. The valley of Papari
I have already mentioned, as being much superior to the rest of the
country. The trees in Brazil are mostly evergreens, and the drought
must be great indeed to make them lose their leaves; but the green
of the leaves of a parched plant, though still a green, is very different
from the bright joyful colour of one that is in full health.
This produced the striking difference between that valley and the
burnt lands above it,&mdash;besides, the misfortunes of other parts made
its good luck more apparent.</p>

<p>I arrived about eleven o’clock in the morning at the city of Natal,
situated upon the banks of the Rio Grande, or Potengi. A foreigner,
who might chance to land first at this place, on his arrival upon the
coast of Brazil, would form a very poor opinion of the state of the
population of the country; for, if places like this are called cities,
what must the towns and villages be; but such a judgment would
not prove correct, for many villages, even of Brazil, surpass this city;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
the rank must have been given to it, not from what it was or is, but
from the expectation of what it might be at some future period.
The settlement upon rising ground, rather removed from the river,
is properly the city, as the parish church is there; it consists of a
square, with houses on each side, having only the ground floor; the
churches, of which there are three, the palace, town-hall, and
prison. Three streets lead from it, which have also a few houses on
each side. No part of the city is paved, although the sand is
deep; on this account, indeed, a few of the inhabitants have raised
a foot path of bricks before their own houses. The place may contain
from six to seven hundred persons.</p>

<p>I rode immediately to the palace, as I had letters of introduction
to the governor, from several of his friends at Pernambuco. He received
me in the most cordial manner. He asked me for my passport,
which I produced; it was scarcely opened, and he immediately
returned it, saying, that he only did this, that all necessary form
might be complied with. He said, that I should stay with him, and he
would provide a house for my people. At one o’clock we dined, and
one of his aide-de-camps was with us. In the afternoon, we walked
down to the lower town. It is situated upon the banks of the river;
the houses stand along the southern bank, and there is only the usual
width of a street between them and the river. This place may contain
from two to three hundred inhabitants, and here live the men of
trade of Rio Grande. The bar of the Potengi is very narrow, but is
sufficiently deep to admit vessels of 150 tons. The northern bank
projects considerably, and for this reason, it is necessary that a ship
should make for it from the southward. The entrance to the reef of
rocks, which lies at some distance from the shore, also requires to
be known, so that altogether the port is a difficult one. The river
is very safe, when once within the bar; the water is deep, and quite
still, and two vessels might swing in its breadth; but it soon becomes
shallow, and in the course of a few miles is greatly diminished.
I should imagine, that six or seven vessels might swing
altogether in the harbour. The bars of rivers that are formed, as in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
this case, of sand, are, however, not to be trusted to, without good
pilots, as they soon change their depth, and even their situation.
When the tide enters, the northern bank is overflowed about one
mile from the mouth of the harbour, and spreads over a considerable
extent of ground, which, even during the ebb, is always wet and
muddy, but never becomes sufficiently deep to prevent passing. The
governor was raising a road over this piece of land, and the work
was then nearly half finished. The new road would be about one
mile in length. The captaincy of Rio Grande is subject to the
governor of Pernambuco, and those of Paraiba and Seara were formerly
in the same situation, but have of late years been formed into
independent provincial governments.</p>

<p>The governor, Francisco de Paula Cavalcante de Albuquerque, is a
native of Pernambuco, and a younger brother of the chief of the
Cavalcante branch of the Albuquerques. His father, a Brazilian
also, was first an ensign in the Recife regiment of the line; he afterwards
established himself upon a sugar-plantation, and made a fortune.
The old man died, and left to each of his sons considerable
property; two remained upon their estates, and still live upon them;
this third son entered the Olinda regiment, and was much beloved
by the men. The regiment had then only one company, of which
he became the commander, and large sums of money taken from his
own purse, were expended by him for their good equipment. He went
to Lisbon on some business relating to his company, and whilst he was
there a <i>denuncia</i>, a private accusation, was given by some enemy to
the family&mdash;that the brothers were forming a conspiracy against the
government. He was obliged to leave Lisbon, afraid of being put under
an arrest, and fled to England, where his reception was such, that he
has ever wished for opportunities of shewing kindness to persons of
that nation. His brothers suffered much in person and in property,
but matters were at last cleared up, as the accusation was proved to be
false. Francisco was immediately promoted to a majority, and soon
afterwards sent to govern Rio Grande. He is a man of talent, and of
proper feelings in regard of his duties,&mdash;enthusiastic in wishing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
to better the condition of the people over whom he was placed. I
am grieved to say, that he has been removed to the insignificant
government of St. Michael’s, one of the Azores or Western Islands.</p>

<p>When he was appointed to Rio Grande, there was scarcely a well
dressed person in it, but he had succeeded in persuading one family
to send for English manufactured goods to Recife&mdash;when once these
were introduced they made their way&mdash;one would not be outdone
by another, and, in the course of two years, they had become general.
We visited the church in the evening&mdash;all the ladies were handsomely
dressed in silks of various colours, and black veils thrown
over the head and face. A twelvemonth previous to this period,
these same persons would have gone to church in petticoats of Lisbon
printed cottons, and square pieces of thick cloth over their heads,
without stockings, and their shoes down at the heels.</p>

<p>The military establishment consists of one hundred and fourteen
men&mdash;one company&mdash;which were in much better order than those
of Pernambuco, or Paraiba. The captaincy of Rio Grande enjoyed
perfect quietude from robberies through his exertions. The governor
promoted the building of a large house, which was going on
very fast, and for which he had subscribed largely; the rent of it was
to be appropriated to the support of the widows of the soldiers of
the captaincy. This work has, I am afraid, been laid aside since his
removal. The situation of the prisoners was very miserable; he
wished to better it, and requested that the principal persons of the
place would take it in turn weekly to carry a bag round to all the
inhabitants, that each might give some trifle to assist in their support;
for some time this went on well, but after a few weeks it was neglected.
He, therefore, took the bag himself, and, accompanied by
one of his aides-de-camps, called at every house. He said, that this
was the most comfortable week the prisoners had ever passed since
their confinement, as more was given by each person than was
usual, and the excellent arrangement was again taken up with ardour,
by the same persons who had neglected it.</p>

<p>A British vessel was wrecked near Natal, and I have always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
understood that the proprietors were perfectly satisfied that every
exertion possible had been made use of to save the property.</p>

<p>The drought of this year had caused a scarcity of the flour of the
mandioc&mdash;the bread of Brazil&mdash;and the price was so high at Recife,
Goiana, &amp;c. that those persons of Rio Grande who possessed it, began
to ship it off for other places; this the governor prohibited; he ordered
it to be sold in the market-place, at a price equal to the gain the
owners would have had by sending it away, and if all was not bought
he took it himself, again giving it out when necessary at the same
price. These anecdotes of him I had partly from himself, but principally
from persons of the place, to whom I was introduced. When
he left the city, on his appointment to St. Michael’s, the people followed
him to some distance, praying for his prosperity.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<p class="pch">CONTINUATION OF THE JOURNEY. FROM NATAL TO AÇU.</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">THE governor did all in his power to dissuade me from proceeding
further, the drought being so great as to render it not
quite prudent; but as I had come so far, I was resolved, at any rate,
to make the attempt. If I had been certain of being able to undertake
the journey at a future period, it would have been better to have
returned, and to have waited until a more favourable season; but I
am rejoiced that I went at that time, as, otherwise, I should most
probably have been under the necessity of foregoing my plan altogether.
Some of the disagreeable circumstances which I met with,
certainly proceeded from the rigour of the season.</p>

<p>I received from the governor a letter of introduction to Aracati.
He also insisted upon my leaving my own horse, that he might be
in good condition when I returned. I was to sleep at a place from
which Rio Grande is supplied with <i>farinha</i> during the drought; but,
in usual years, it is too wet to be cultivated, unless it was drained,
and of this operation scarcely any notions are entertained. At
Natal, I purchased another horse. I crossed the river in a canoe, and
the horses and men upon <i>jangadas</i>; we were landed upon the new
raised road, and immediately beyond it overtook some persons who
were going to the <i>Lagoa Seca</i>, or dry lake above-mentioned, where I
was to purchase maize and <i>farinha</i>, for crossing the tract of country
through which runs the river Seara-meirim. We left the usual road,
and turned down a narrow path, which leads to this lake; it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
overhung with trees. I struck my head against a branch of one of
these, and found that I had disturbed a large family which had taken
up its residence upon it; my shoulders were quickly covered with
small red ants, and I did not get rid of them without feeling some of
their bites. We arrived at the dry lake about six o’clock in the
evening, and put up at one of the cottages. In the course of the
following morning, I made known my principal errand, and that I
likewise wished to purchase another horse. The people who were
residing here, had removed from high lands which had on this season
proved barren; they had erected small huts, some of which had not
been finished, and the family, therefore, lived in public; these huts had
only a roof to shelter their inhabitants, who expected that the first
heavy rain would drive them back to their usual habitations, as these
lands, after violent rains, are laid under water. Each man possessed
his small field of mandioc and maize. I left John’s horse here in
charge of one of these men, as it began to give way, and I proceeded
with four loaded horses; two as before, and one of <i>farinha</i>, and
another of maize. I had provided myself at Rio Grande with leathern
bags, for carrying water, and several other necessary things which I
had not been instructed to bring, but which experience had taught
me the necessity of possessing.</p>

<p>We remained at this place during one entire day, and the next
morning set off, intending to sleep at a hamlet, called Pai Paulo.
We rested at mid-day near to a well, and in the afternoon proceeded.
Wells are generally formed in these parts by digging a hole in the
ground, to the depth of two or three feet, until the water appears;
if a person in the neighbourhood of one of them, who takes water
from it, should be nice about these matters, a fence is made round it,
but if not, as is oftener the case, the well remains open, and the cattle
come down to drink at it. These pits or wells are called <i>caçimbas</i>.
The grass was much burnt up, but still there was plenty of it. In
the afternoon we passed over some stony ground,&mdash;it was the first I
had met with, and it was very painful to the horses which had come
from the sandy soil of Pernambuco; but we soon entered upon a long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
though narrow plain, bounded by brushwood, over which the road was
clear, and the grass burnt up entirely on each side. We overtook a
white man on foot, with twelve loaded horses, and a very small poney
which carried a saddle; the loads were all alike, each horse carrying
two skins or bags of some kind of provisions. I was much surprised
at the circumstance of this man having the management of so many
horses, because generally, the number of men is nearly equal to that
of the beasts. I observed that his horses began to spread upon the
plain, and seemed inclined to take to the brushwood; I called to my
guide to ride to the right, whilst I did the same to the left, and go in
quickly between them and the wood, to prevent the animals from
separating. The man thanked me, which brought on further conversation;
he asked the guide where we intended to sleep, and was
answered, “at Pai Paulo.” The wells at Pai Paulo, he told us, were
all dried up, and the inhabitants had deserted their houses. What
was to be done: he said, that he intended to remain upon a plain
two leagues distant from where we then were, that no water was to
be had there, but that for our party and himself, his slave would bring
a sufficient quantity, who had remained behind to fill a skin at a well
which we had passed. There was no alternative; to remain here
was impossible, for there was no grass. Therefore I ordered Julio and
his companion to let our horses and those of our new friend remain
together, and to look to them equally. The slave soon joined us
with the water, gave the skin to my guide, and went on to assist
Julio, whilst I advanced very slowly, that I might have some more
conversation with the owner of the <i>comboio</i>, or convoy, which we had
thus joined. He was the son of a man of property, who resided
upon the banks of the Açu, and possessed several cattle estates in
those parts; the old man was a colonel of militia, and he with whom
I conversed, was the major of the same regiment. The drought had
been so severe with them, that they feared a famine, and he had been
sent down to the coast to purchase <i>farinha</i> for the family, which the
skins contained, with the exception of one load consisting of maize
for his horses. After he had purchased his <i>farinha</i> he heard of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
prohibition of the governor respecting it, and understood that a guard
of soldiers was to be sent down to the lake to take it from him; he had,
therefore, stolen a march, and that nothing might be suspected, he
had left all his people, excepting this one slave, and had even left his
cloaths. His saddle horse carried a heavy load, and he set off a day
before he had intended; the animal upon which he had placed his
saddle was a colt and too young to bear any further weight. Thus was
this major, in true Brazilian campaigning style, in his shirt and
drawers, his <i>alpargatas</i> or sandals, upon his feet, his musquet upon
his shoulder, his sword by his side, hanging from a belt over one
shoulder, and his long knife in his girdle. He was a stout, handsome
man, about forty years of age, and where his skin was not exposed,
it was as white as that of a European, but his face, neck, and legs
were of a dark brown colour. This man, who at other times enjoyed
all the comforts that his country affords, who was respected for his
rank and wealth, was obliged to make this journey absolutely to save
the lives of his family. True it is, that he is not to be considered as
we should persons of his situation in Europe; like most of these
people, he had been from his infancy daily accustomed to what men
in a more civilised state would account very great hardships.</p>

<p>The <i>alpargatas</i> are pieces of leather, of a size rather larger than
the soles of the feet of the person for whom they are intended.
Two loops are fastened in front of each, through which two of the
toes are placed; there is a ring of leather round each ankle, through
which are drawn and tied two thongs, which proceed from each side
of the hinder part. These are the shoes of the Brazilians, who live
removed from great and improving towns. Julio was now provided
with a pair of them, else I hardly know how he could have
proceeded.</p>

<p>We halted at the place appointed, upon an immense plain; the
grass was all gone, and even the hardy trees, the acaju and mangaba,
seemed to feel the want of water, for their leaves had begun to fall.
The two parties took up their stations under separate clumps of
trees; but upon these plains, the trees scarcely ever grow sufficiently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
near to each other, to enable the traveller to hang his hammock
between two of them. The poor horses were taken to a dell at some
distance, to try to pick up what they could find, that had escaped the
drought and the traveller. Our allowance of water was not large,
and therefore we were afraid of eating much salt meat; we did not
pass the night comfortably, for the wind rose, and scattered our fires,
nor did we sleep much, and at four o’clock the horses were fetched
to give to each of them a feed of maize. One of them refused to eat
his portion.</p>

<p>The following morning we advanced to Pai Paulo, three leagues
further, still crossing the same plain, at the extremity of which we
first approached the Seara-meirim, and on the opposite side from that
on which we were, stands the village of Pai Paulo, upon rising ground.
This was, without exception, the most desolate place I ever beheld;
the roofs of some of the cottages were falling in, the walls of others
had fallen, but the roofs remained. The course of the river was
only marked by the depth of its bed, for the soil around was a loose
sand, destitute of any covering, and nothing differing from that in the
channel of the river. The trees had mostly lost their leaves. I had
now entered upon the Sertam, and surely it deserves the name. We
passed Pai Paulo, and about noon reached an open well of brackish
water, dug in the bed of the river; our Pernambuco horses at first refused
to drink, but the dirt was cleared away, as much as possible, for
them, and the water left to settle; however, even then, they did
little more than taste it. Here we were to rest, and to give our horses
some maize, for there was no grass. The same horse again refused
his feed; the guide said that he supposed he was not accustomed to
it, and therefore must be taught to like it, otherwise he could not possibly
get over this barren track of country. The first operation was
to soak the maize in water, until it softened,&mdash;then the guide forced
some of it down the animal’s throat, closing forcibly its mouth.
Whether this had the effect, or hunger, I know not; but at night he
performed his part pretty well, taking rather more time than the
others to finish his feed. I drank a small portion of the water,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
mixing it with lemon juice and sugar, which I had with me. We
carried some of this water on with us, for at night we should find
none. The country presented the same appearance; we crossed the
Seara-meirim several times, which in some parts had large rocks in
the centre of the bed. At night I was not much inclined to eat, but
I made up by smoking. We found a sheltered place behind part of
the bank of the river, and slung our hammocks upon sloping ground,
as the wind rises about eleven or twelve o’clock in these parts, and
renders shelter very requisite; it sometimes blows hard: it is a dry
wind, but healthy.</p>

<p>The following day, we proceeded again in the same manner. I
had by this time fully entered into the custom of smoking early, and
as we could never get any thing cooked until twelve o’clock, I found
that this prevented any unpleasant sense of hunger. My people
could not have any thing to eat early, as it would have caused
delay, therefore it would not have been proper for me to show a bad
example. I had become very intimate with my friend the major&mdash;he
learnt from me that we had horses, and cows, and dogs in England,
and he liked me the better for this; at first, he wondered how
it happened that I could ride; he thought I must be an apt scholar
to have learnt since I had gone over to Brazil. He was also much
surprized to hear that we had churches in England, which he had
never understood before. He said he should not believe henceforwards
that the English were <i>Pagoens</i>, heathens. I told him that one
chief point upon which our religion differed from his, was in ours
not enjoining us to confess; he thought confession a great annoyance,
but he could not doubt its propriety.</p>

<p>We reached another dirty pool or well of water in the river, which
we had again crossed several times. Our resting-place at mid-day
afforded no shelter, excepting what could be obtained from one small
shrub, which was in full leaf. The leaves or branches of it reached
to the ground. I lay down upon the sand, and pushed my head in
among them, covering the rest of my body with a hide; this was a
hot birth, but better than to be completely exposed to the sun. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
was astonished at the appearance of this shrub. There are two
kinds of trees in certain parts of the Sertam, which are called Pereiro
and Yco; both seem to flourish most when the seasons are the driest,
and both are particularly dangerous to horses; that is, as they do no
mischief to the wild cattle or wild horses, they may be supposed not to
possess any pernicious qualities if the animals which eat their leaves
are not overheated and fatigued; the latter of these plants kills the travellers’
beasts, and the former has the effect of appearing to produce
intoxication, and sometimes also proves fatal. The major said,
that this part of the country abounded in these trees, and consequently
our horses were tied to those around us, and to each was given a feed
of maize. The plant, of which I have spoken above, was very beautiful,
the green of its leaves was bright and healthy, and I afterwards
saw many more of them upon this <i>travesia</i> or crossing. I particularly
observed them on this track of country, as other plants had lost
all appearance of life.</p>

<p>We were less unpleasantly situated at night, as the water though
brackish was comparatively clear.</p>

<p>The following day we had still the same country and river to
cross. The consciousness of having advanced upon our journey alone
caused the knowledge of a change of situation, so exactly similar was
the face of the country. At mid-day we had again no shelter from
the sun. The water was little different from that of the preceding
day. I laid down under the shady side of a rock, which afforded
sufficient shelter until the sun began to decline, and throw its rays
into the quarter under which I had taken up my station. We had
often seen cattle about the pools or wells&mdash;on this occasion, one
miserable cow came down to drink; the major happened to be near
the pool at the time. He looked at the mark she bore, and knew it
to be that of the cattle upon his own estates. “How can this animal,”
he exclaimed, “have strayed so far from its own home?”
The want of water had made it stray at least one hundred leagues.
This day we overtook a party of Sertanejos, as the inhabitants of
the Sertam are called, likewise going our way. They were at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
mid-day resting-place, and one of their horses was, at the time of our
coming up, tottering from having eaten of the Yco; they were trying
to give it maize, in the hope of recovering it, as this is said to
have the effect, if it is taken soon after; but at the time we left
them, the animal, when he fell, was with difficulty raised, and the
major said that he thought him too far gone. I never heard whether
these persons returned, or still advanced after this misfortune. I observed
in the afternoon several heaps of rocks in the bed of the river,
which must form beautiful falls of water when the stream is rapid.</p>

<p>Towards evening my guide began to try me. I found that there
had been some conversation between him and the two Indians respecting
the journey, and now he sounded me about returning. I
told him I had perfectly determined to go on, and that I would
most certainly shoot the man who attempted to go back, and that
even if he then escaped me, I would follow him until I overtook him.
He had not said that he would return, but had hinted at the danger
of the undertaking at this season, and that the two lads were afraid
of proceeding, but I knew him to be the mover. At night he could
not have found his way back, as the only mark of a road that was to
be perceived, proceeded from the sand being more worn away, and
the banks of the river being broken down at the proper crossings.
In fact, the marks were such, that even in the day-time, a man accustomed
to this description of road could alone find it out&mdash;therefore
I was certain that desertion could only take place in the day-time,
which was almost impossible, as I always rode in the rear of the
whole party. The guide had no fire-arms of his own; besides he
never would have made any attempt to murder me, as he knew how
little I slept, and that my pistols were always with me in my hammock,
besides any thing of this sort could only have been done in concert
with Julio, who, in the sequel, proved worthy of the greatest confidence.
I found more necessity to be on my guard in returning, when
John was no longer with me; however, although this man had sufficient
courage he had no watchfulness. The summary manner in
which I threatened to treat the guide, can only be justified by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
necessity of the case, for had he returned, the two Indians would most
probably likewise have deserted me. If a man suffers himself to be
trifled with, he cannot possibly succeed under circumstances such as
these; however, I made the threat under the conviction of that being
sufficient.</p>

<p>We carried water from the resting-place at mid-day, and, as usual,
fixed our quarters at night upon the banks of the river.</p>

<p>The next day we advanced again exactly in the same manner, but
at noon, to our dismay, there was no water; the pool had dried up, but
we rested the horses for a short time, notwithstanding this dreadful
disappointment. My thirst was great, for I had not drank the night
before. We had still some lemons left, which were distributed, and
these afforded much relief. In the afternoon the major told me to
follow his example, and put a pebble into my mouth, which was
the usual resource of the Sertanejos on these occasions. I did so,
and certainly found that it produced considerable moisture. This
was a dismal day, and we knew not whether we should be able to reach
a well before some of our horses failed. One of those belonging to the
major, already ran loose among the others, as he was weak, and his
load had been changed to the horse which had carried the maize, the
remainder of this being distributed in small portions, that it might be
carried by the rest. My horses bore it very well, as those which had
been loaded with provisions were, of course, in part relieved, and the
largest load, that of my trunk and case of bottles, was carried by
each of them in turn, that the hard work might be equally divided.
This day we passed some deserted cottages. Our night was very
miserable, for some of the horses refused to finish their feeds of maize;
the danger of their failing prevented our thinking so much of our
own inconvenience&mdash;my spirits were kept up by the necessity I felt
of keeping up those of others. John was not quite well, and this
made me uneasy, as it was as much as we could do to carry ourselves;
indeed, had any of the party fallen sick, I know not how we
should have proceeded.</p>

<p>The next morning, about nine o’clock, we reached a well to our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
great joy, but, fortunately for us, the water was so bad, that we could
not drink much; it was as usual dirty and brackish, but of the first
draught I shall never forget the delight;&mdash;when I tried a second, I
could not take it, the taste was so very nauseous. On looking round,
we saw some goats, Julio went towards them, and then discovered
some fowls, proceeded a little farther and found an inhabited cottage.
He came and gave us the joyful intelligence; we determined to remain
here to rest, if the people could give us any hopes of food for
our horses. I found an elderly woman and her two daughters in the
hut; the father was not at home. The old woman seemed quite
astonished to hear that we had crossed the Seara-Meirim; she said,
she did not know how soon she and her family might be obliged to
leave their cottage, as many others had done. She directed the major
and my people to a dell at some distance, where dry grass and
leaves might perhaps still be picked up; she said, that it was the
last place which could have any, for travellers did not in general
know of it, and she and her husband made a point of not discovering
it. But I paved the way, by making her a present of some <i>farinha</i>,
throwing maize to the fowls, and by pouring in an immense number
of <i>minhas Senhoras</i>. I had purchased a kid and a fowl, and laid down
the money immediately. Persons circumstanced as these were, are
sometimes robbed in a most unpardonable manner by travellers, who
take advantage of their houses, eat their poultry, and leave them
without paying; but considering the entire non-existence of law in
these regions, I am only surprized that greater enormities are not
committed; however, every man feels it to be his own case, if he has
a house and family; he is aware that on going from home, those he
may leave are in the same helpless state. These persons and their
property were at the mercy of any travellers; if they had been
murdered, and the cottage from being deserted began to fall, it would
have been supposed that its inhabitants, like many others, had decamped,
and no enquiry would be made about the direction they
had taken, such is the rambling disposition of the people in general,
and the state of this part of the country, at the period of which I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
speak. They have nothing to make them remain upon one spot,
neither comfort nor security.</p>

<p>In the afternoon we advanced as usual, and passed some deserted
cottages, but towards the close of the day arrived at some that were
inhabited, and at dusk put up near to two or three that stood together,
after having crossed the Seara-Meirim for the last and forty-second
time. This river takes its sources from the mountains to the
northward, in the same direction as those of the river Açu, of which
I shall have occasion to speak. The Seara-Meirim falls into the
Potengi, and perhaps some branches of it bend their course as far as
the Paraiba. The face of the country presents one continued flat,
from Pai Paulo to the place at which we left the river; the soil is a loose
sand, which is sometimes, though rarely, intermixed with black earth.
The trees are thinly scattered, and, at the time that I travelled, were
without leaves. The river winds like the coils of a serpent, to have followed
them would have been endless; it sometimes fills after heavy
rain, in the course of a very short time, the water coming down in a
torrent, delayed only by the inequality of the depth of the channel,
and the walls with which the rocks in some parts oppose its progress.
The sand in the bed of the river is little different from that of which
the banks are composed, being however on the whole thicker, and
approaching nearer to gravel. The water which oozes from it, on
digging into the sand, is in all parts brackish, and in some places is
too salt for any use to be made of it. This is not, however, peculiar
to the Seara-Meirim, for I found that all the beds of the rivers which
become dry in the summer contained more or less salt; at best, the
water taken from them was never quite sweet.</p>

<p>The place at which we had arrived is reckoned to be distant forty
leagues from Natal; the league of the Sertam is never less than
four miles, and is often much more; there are <i>legoas grandes</i>, <i>legoas
pequenas</i>, and <i>legoas de nada</i>, or nothing leagues, which I have found
quite long enough, notwithstanding their encouraging name. Pai
Paulo may be about eight or ten leagues from Natal, which makes
the <i>travesia</i> or barren-crossing, thirty or thirty-two leagues. We advanced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
at about three miles within the hour or rather more, and
travelled from half-past five to ten in the morning, and in the afternoon
from two, or half-past two, to six o’clock.</p>

<p>We had now reached again the habitations of man; there was still
the same burnt-up appearance, but the wells were taken care of, the
water was better, and grass, although it was dry, was still to be had. I
intended to accompany the Major, part of the way to his home, or the
whole, but it was necessary that I should be guided by circumstances,&mdash;by
the accounts we heard of the state of the country;&mdash;we advanced
in our usual manner, resting more at mid-day, traversing
a dead flat, and passing two or three <i>Fazendas</i>, or cattle estates, each
day, of which the live stock was looking very miserable, and the people
half starved.</p>

<p>After being with the Major four days, since we had left the Seara-Meirim,
I saw that it would not be prudent to proceed farther; the
accounts from the interior were bad, and we arrived at one estate,
of which the cattle were all dying, and the people intending, if there
was no rain very soon, to leave their houses. I now judged myself to
be distant from the coast not less than two hundred miles. We had
advanced northward and westward, and were therefore not far to the
southward of Açu, but were to the westward of it. I now resolved
to make for it, for my horses might fail, and all the country was in so
bad a state, that we might not have found others in a proper condition
to go on with us; in fact, as I was not acting from orders, but
merely for my own amusement, and as the guide was afraid of proceeding,
I did not think I was authorized in persevering; if I had
had orders for the purpose, the case would have been altered, and
I must have run all hazards. Here, also, desertion was easier in
the night, as the country was comparatively inhabited towards Açu&mdash;the
difficulty was in advancing, and not in retreating.</p>

<p>Each cattle estate has a tolerably decent house, in which the owner
or herdsman resides, and usually a few smaller habitations are scattered
about upon the plain around it. The pens stand near to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
principal house, and enable the travellers to distinguish immediately,
although at some distance, the site of a <i>Fazenda</i>.</p>

<p>I heard of a strange custom existing in these parts of the country
that are so thinly inhabited, which arises from this state of things.
Certain priests obtain a licence from the bishop (of Pernambuco,)
and travel through these regions with a small altar constructed for
the purpose; of a size to be placed upon one side of a pack-saddle,
and they have with them all their apparatus for saying mass. Thus
with a horse conveying the necessary paraphernalia, and a boy to
drive it, who likewise assists in saying mass, and another horse on
which the priest himself rides, and carries his own small portmanteau,
these men make in the course of the year between 150 and 200<i>l.</i>&mdash;a
large income in Brazil, but hardly earned, if the inconveniences
and privations which they must undergo to obtain it are taken into
consideration. They stop and erect the altar wherever a sufficient
number of persons who are willing to pay for the mass is collected.
This will sometimes be said for three or four shillings, but at other
times, if a rich man takes a fancy to a priest, or has a fit of extreme
devotion upon him, he will give eight or ten <i>mil reis</i>, two or three
pounds, and it does happen, that one hundred <i>mil reis</i> are received for
saying a mass, but this is very rare;&mdash;at times an ox or an horse, or
two or three, are given. These men have their use in the world;
if this custom did not exist, all form of worship would be completely
out of the reach of the inhabitants of many districts, or at any rate
they would not be able to attend more than once or twice in the
course of the year, for it must be remembered that there is no church
within twenty or thirty leagues of some parts; besides, where there is
no law, nor real, rational religion, any thing is better than nothing.
They christen and marry, and thus preserve these necessary forms of
religion, and prevent a total forgetfulness of the established rules of
civilised society; a sufficient link is kept up to make any of these
people, if they removed into more populous districts, conform to
received ideas.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>I left the Major<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> to pursue his journey homewards, whilst I retreated,
or rather advanced, in a contrary direction, but a retreat it
was from this inhospitable region. We found no change during that
day, and if we had not met with a good natured herdsman, should
have fared very badly for want of water, unless we had seen some other
person equally well disposed. I asked him the way to the nearest
estate, which he told me, and then I made enquiries about water,
to which he answered, that unless I was acquainted with the place,
I should not find the well, and this part of our conversation ended
by his turning back to show it to me, regardless of thus increasing
his journey four or five miles. I asked him when we arrived at the
well to stay and dine with me, for although I had no great dainties
to offer, still he carried only what provision his <i>boroacas</i> contained.
These are small leathern bags, one of which hangs on each side of the
saddle. He would not, however, dismount, and immediately turned
his horse and went his way. My guide had remained behind, as his
horse was rather lame, and now he joined us. We passed over some
stony ground, and the well itself was situated among rocks, between
two of which the horses passed and descended to it.</p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>I may give some description of my friend, who turned back to shew
me the well, and this may be taken as the usual appearance of a travelling
Sertanejo. He rode a small horse with a long tail and mane;
his saddle was rather raised before and behind; his stirrups were of
rusty iron, and his bit was of the same; the reins were two very
narrow thongs. His dress consisted of long pantaloons or leggings,
of tanned but undressed leather, of a rusty brown colour, which were
tied tight round his waist, and under these are worn a pair of cotton
drawers or trowsers, as the seat is left unprotected by the leather.
He had a tanned goat skin over his breast, which was tied behind by four
strings, and a jacket also made of leather, which is generally thrown
over one shoulder; his hat was of the same, with a very shallow
crown, and small brim; he had slip-shod slippers of the same colour,
and iron spurs upon his naked heels,&mdash;the straps which go under the
feet prevent the risk of losing the slippers. A long whip of twisted
thongs hung from his right wrist; he had a sword by his side, hanging
from a belt over one shoulder; his knife was in his girdle, and
his short dirty pipe in his mouth. Fastened to his saddle behind,
was a piece of red baize, rolled up in the form of a great coat, and
this usually contains a hammock and a change of linen,&mdash;a shirt, and
drawers, and perhaps a pair of nankeen pantaloons; his <i>boroacas</i>
hung also on each side of the back of his saddle, and these generally
contain <i>farinha</i> and dried meat on one side, and on the other, a flint
and steel, (dried leaves serve as tinder) tobacco, and a spare pipe.
To this equipment is sometimes added, a large pistol, thrust partly
under the left thigh, and thus secured. The usual pace of the Sertanejo’s
horse is a walk, approaching to a short trot; so that the
horses of these people often have acquired the habit of dragging their
hind legs, and throwing up the dust. The usual colour of the Sertanejos
is a dark brown; for even those who are born white, soon
become as completely tanned as the dress which they wear, from exposure
to the sun. The annexed print will give some idea of the
Sertanejo, as he is daily seen in Recife. The colour of the leather,
as it is represented in the print, is brighter than that of the dresses
which are usually to be met with, which is owing to the drawing
having been made from a dress that had not been much used.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>At one of the estates I heard an anecdote, which is illustrative of
the neglect or the impossibility, on all occasions, of conforming to
religious duties. A priest, on passing, was requested by the wife of
the owner of the place to stay, for the purpose of baptizing her son;
he consented to this, but after waiting some time, said, that he
wished to proceed upon his journey, and therefore desired that the
child might be brought to him; the woman answered, “Pray, wait a
short time longer, as the boy has taken the horses to water, and will
soon return.” The priest was surprised, but was still more astonished,
when he was required to christen a fellow of thirteen or fourteen
years of age.</p>

<p>The next day we still proceeded over the same sort of ground, in
parts stony, and where stony, it was rather hilly; but not sufficiently
so to form a decided ridge of hills. John was, at night, taken suddenly
ill; he had drank too much water, and would not mix any
spirit with it, neither would he smoke. I considered smoking as
almost absolutely necessary for the preservation of health on these
occasions; it is generally practised among the people of the country,
and indeed many of the women are as fond of it as their husbands.
Towards the morning, the man recovered.</p>

<p>The following day we reached, at ten o’clock, the estate of St.
Luzia; it is situated upon a wide plain, similar to those upon which
we had been travelling for many days. This is a <i>campina</i>, and not a
<i>taboleiro</i>. There were no trees upon it, excepting a few near to
the well. The sight of this place raised our spirits, for there was no
want of water, nor of grass, though it was completely dry. The lots,
<i>lotes</i>, of mares came down to drink, all in fine condition, followed
and protected by the master horse of each lot; the cattle, the sheep,
and every other living thing, seemed to enjoy and to be conscious of
the abundance of which they were reaping the advantage. We unloaded
near to the well under the trees. The house of the chief
herdsman stood before us, distant about one hundred yards, upon
rather higher ground; it was a low white washed cottage, with the
stables, pens, &amp;c. on each side. About twelve o’clock, I saw some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
men employed in milking the goats; I sent Julio with a half-gourd for
some milk, desiring him to offer payment; the guide cautioned me
not, but still I ordered Julio to present the money. The milk came,
but the money was not taken, and soon afterwards, three of the men,
came down towards us; I thanked them for the milk; and they addressed
me saying, that they wished to know if I had intended to insult
them, by offering payment, as such things were not customary in
their country:&mdash;the guide had told me I should affront them, and
therefore I had brought this upon myself; but I put them into good
humour by answering that they would pardon my mistake, when I told
them, that I belonged to a country, in which we were obliged to purchase
the sand with which we scoured our houses. They then said,
that the boy, on going for the milk, had mentioned that there was an
Englishman in company, whom they wished much to see, as it was a
<i>bicho</i>, an animal, they had never seen. I said that he was gone with
the horses, and would soon return. I meant John,&mdash;however the
guide soon told them that I was an Englishman. Their countenances
shewed much disappointment, when they were persuaded that this
was true; they had expected to see some strange beast. John soon
came, and he certainly was a curiosity, for he did not speak Portugueze;
and when any thing went wrong, he swore away in English,
at which they were all astonishment: they said, “He speaks the negro
language<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>.” They sat upon the ground near to my hammock, and
asked me of the news from Pernambuco, for they cared about nothing
more distant. I was acquainted at Recife with the owner of the place,
which I made them confident was the case, by describing his house and
garden, and they asked me after him, &amp;c. The conversation concluded
by an offer of horses to proceed, and, on their return to the house, a
present of dried meat was sent. Thus I was in the end a gainer, by
offering to pay for the milk; but I was more careful ever after.</p>

<p>From St. Luzia, we proceeded across the plain, expecting to reach a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
lake, of which the guide had some recollection; but when the night
had already closed in, we were still upon the same endless plain,
over which the track was only marked by the sand upon it being
more worn away, consequently, it might easily be lost at night.
The lake at which we had entertained hopes of arriving, never becomes
entirely dry in the summer; but there was only one place at
which it could be crossed, therefore it would be dangerous to reach its
borders in the dark. The plain presented no tempting lodging;
there were several rocks upon it of different sizes, but no trees, and
the wind blew hard. The guide dismounted, to feel if there was any
of the long dry grass where we were; on not finding any, he walked
to the left of the road, but was not successful; he then tried to the
right, and found some. We only discovered his situation by the
sound of his voice; he called, and we answered, several times, until
at last we joined him; he had also discovered a large rock, under
the lee of which we unloaded, and then lighted our fire, and
fettered the horses to feed. We soon found, that to cook any victuals
was impossible, for the wind scattered our fire, which was only formed
of the branches of the small shrubs and briars that grow upon these
plains. Water we had by accident, as the guide had brought a small
skin of it, in case he should be thirsty during the afternoon, for we had
made ourselves quite certain of reaching the lake by night. I slept
upon two of our packages, under the lee of the rock, and the whole
party did the same, sharing, as equally as possible, our scanty means
of accommodation. This afternoon I had seen many rocks of remarkable
forms; one, particularly, struck me as extraordinary: it
was placed upon another, of much smaller dimensions, and the resting-point
was so small, as to render its removal apparently easy; but,
on trial, it had not the slightest motion. The discomfort of this night
was great, caused chiefly by the violence of the wind; we had, at last,
no fire,&mdash;all was dark around us, and we could scarcely make ourselves
heard. The horses seemed to feel as much as we did, the unsheltered
situation; they were near to us during the whole of the night.</p>

<p>On continuing our journey the following morning, we discovered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
that we had halted within half a league of the lake. The water was
all gone; but the ground was boggy, and not to be crossed, excepting
at the place over which is the usual path. It extends to the right and
left to a considerable distance, but is not broad. If the mud was
cleared away, it might, perhaps, afford an inexhaustible source of
water to the neighbourhood; but Brazil is not in a state for such
works; hands, in these parts, are not yet sufficiently numerous. In
the afternoon, we crossed some stony hills, and passed by two <i>fazendas</i>.
This day, I observed, at some distance, a high hill, of a circular
form, standing quite alone, and unconnected with any other high
ground. Its sides appeared to be too steep for horses to ascend; and
I much regret not being so situated as to be enabled to delay, for the
purpose of taking a nearer and more exact view of it. The guide was
surprised at my curiosity about it, and told me that horses could not
go up its sides, that there were snakes upon it, &amp;c. All this might be
true; but it was evidently said, to prevent any intention I might have
had of delaying to see it more correctly. The plain appeared in many
parts, as if the sea had at some time covered it;&mdash;the dead flat, the
sand in places mixed with particles of a substance which looked like
broken shells, and the rocks worn away in such parts, as, from their
situation, could not have been acted upon by rain. We slept this
night at an estate, where there were several houses forming a hamlet,
having passed through a considerable quantity of wooded land.</p>

<p>The next morning we again proceeded over some lands that were
covered with wood; and, near twelve o’clock, reached the town of
Açu. Oh, the joy of again seeing a church! of the sight of a regular
village, and civilized persons; if even these can be called civilized,
according to European ideas.</p>

<p>The country I passed over from Natal, never can, in any state of
civilization, or from any increase of population, be rendered a fertile
track; but it might be, without doubt, much improved, if proper
wells were sunk, reservoirs made for rain water, and trees planted;
much might be done. The plains I crossed are of three kinds; those
of which the soil is a loose sand, producing the acaju, the mangaba<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
and several kinds of palm or cabbage trees; upon them the grass is
short, and of a kind which is not reckoned nourishing; in these situations
are likewise produced several creeping plants, similar to those
growing upon the common lands, near the sea-shore, in England, and
the trees are thinly scattered. The fruit of the acaju or cashew tree,
and of the mangaba, are most delightful, and are doubly acceptable
in crossing the sands upon which they are to be met with. The
former has been often described; the latter is a small round fruit, and
is not unlike a crab-apple in appearance, but it is sweet, and is unfit
to be eaten until it drops from the tree; the pulp is fibrous but soft,
and three seeds or kernels are contained in it, of which the taste
approaches that of almonds. The palm or cabbage trees<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> also afford
fruits, which are eaten when other food fails; but these are insipid.</p>

<p>These plains are the <i>taboleiros</i>, of which there exists also another
kind, which are covered with brushwood, of stinted height, from the
nature of the soil, but it is close and higher than a man on horseback.
The road lies, in many places, through it; but as it does not afford any
shade, and prevents the wind from alleviating the intenseness of the
heat; it is here that the power of the sun is fully felt. This
brushwood is, however, not too thick to prevent cattle from breaking
their way through it, and feeding among it. The third description of
plains are those of a better kind of soil, which produce good nourishing
grass, but upon these no trees grow; small shrubs and briars
alone are to be seen, and oftentimes not even these. They are, in
parts, stony, and have rising ground upon them, which is not sufficiently
high to deserve the name of a ridge of hills; but is enough to
break the ocean-like flatness and immensity which these plains sometimes
present to the traveller; after proceeding for hours, the same distance
still seems to remain for him to traverse. These are the <i>campinas</i>.
I passed over some spots covered with high trees, which in our own
country would be called woods of considerable extent; but in Brazil,
they could not be accounted of sufficient magnitude to compose a distinguishing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
feature in the naked regions which I traversed. The
impression which a recollection of this portion of land left upon my
mind, is of a flat uncovered country.</p>

<p>I heard very little of beasts of prey; they had removed to better
districts, I suppose; nor were we much troubled with snakes. But
my people never failed, in taking up our quarters, to look well around,
which proves their frequent appearance, else this cautious behaviour
would not have become habitual with them. I merely say, that they
are not plentiful in this barren part; for elsewhere, near lakes and
large pools of water, in fertile districts, the rattle of the snake, of
which this is the distinguishing mark, is often heard. We saw a
small kind of rabbit, near rocky ground, which is called <i>moco</i>. The
<i>carapato</i> or tick, and the <i>chigua</i> had entirely disappeared, since we
left the dry lake, near Natal. The <i>chigua</i> has been so often described,
that a minute account of it in this place is unnecessary; it is a very
small insect, which lodges itself principally under the nails of the
feet. In the country, bordering upon the sea, it is to be found
most abundantly in sandy districts; and yet, although the plains of
the Sertam appear to be formed of the same kind of sand, the insect
is not to be met with in the whole track of country between Natal
and Aracati.</p>

<p>We arrived at Açu on the 1st December, having travelled about
340 miles in 19 days. The continual anxiety in which I was kept,
prevented me from keeping any regular journal of my proceedings.
From Açu to Aracati, I have preserved the names of the places
through which I passed. The country is more inhabited, and I was
nearer to the coast; I travelled also with more ease; but, between
Natal and Açu, excepting the deserted Pai Paulo, I did not pass
any settlement which deserved even the name of village; single
cottages, much separated from each other, and often uninhabited,
contained the whole population of this district. It is a miserable,
desolate country.</p>

<p>The town of Açu is built in a square, and consists of about
three hundred inhabitants; it has two churches, and a town-hall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
and prison, at that time building; the governor was the promoter of
the work. The place stands upon the great river of Açu, where
it runs in two channels for a short distance; it is situated upon
the northern bank of the smaller branch. There is an island of sand
between the two branches, and the distance from whence the river is
divided to where it is again united, is about two or perhaps three
miles. We crossed their dry beds, and entered the square, which is
not paved, and the sand is deep. Many of the inhabitants were at
their doors, for all travellers are objects of curiosity, and our appearance
increased it. I rode upon an English saddle, and this particularly
attracted the notice of an equestrian people. The houses have
only the ground floor; some of them are plastered, and white-washed,
but the mud of which others are composed, remains in its natural
colour, both within and without, and the floors also are of earth; so
that in spite of the greatest care, when water is scarce, their inhabitants
cannot keep themselves clean. Though the lower class of Brazilians,
of all casts, have many dirty customs, allied to those of savage
life, still they are remarkably clean in their persons; one of the
greatest inconveniences of a situation, when a Brazilian complains
of the place he happens to reside in, is the want of a river or pool of
water in the neighbourhood, for the purpose of bathing.</p>

<p>We enquired for the house of a man of colour, a saddler by trade,
with whom my guide was acquainted. This person, like many others,
had come to his door to see the travellers; he soon recognised his
friend, and came forwards to speak to him. He procured a house
for us during our stay; it was a small place, upon which neither
plaster nor white wash had been bestowed, with two rooms, one opening
to the square, and the other to the river. When we were a little
settled, and I had dressed myself, I sallied forth to visit the vicar,
who resided in the best, or rather least miserable looking habitation
in the town; it was about the size of the cottages of labourers, or
small farmers in England, but not nearly so comfortable, though
the floors were bricked. It is true, that this climate does not demand,
as much as those of bleaker regions, that necessary of an English<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
dwelling, of English growth, that undefinable something, called
comfort. I told him, I had called upon him, as the first person of
the neighbourhood, and that I should always be happy in my proceedings
to have the prayers and good wishes of his order, and particularly
his, as the governor had spoken so very highly of him.
Some further conversation passed between us; but I did not stay
long, for I was much tired. I made arrangements for sending my
horses towards Piatô, where grass was to be had, and the green stalks
of maize, sugar cane, and other plants; but the guide recommended
that we should not stay here longer than was necessary. He said,
that whilst the horses continued on their journey, they would bear
up very well; but if they were suffered to rest, they would become
stiff, lose flesh, and be rendered entirely unfit for service, for a considerable
time. I did not then quite believe him, but as there was
no object in staying, I desired Julio to return with them to Açu the
next day at two o’clock, that we and they might have, at any rate, a
rest of twenty-four hours. I afterwards learnt, by experience, that
the guide was quite right regarding the horses; that regular work is
better than a rest of more than one whole day.</p>

<p>Our friend, the saddler, among other stories, mentioned having
passed over the same ground which we had traversed from St. Luzia,
only a short time before us. He was in company with another man
and a boy, and had also a dog with him; they had put up for the
night under shelter of one of the rocks, in the vicinity of the lake of
which I have spoken. His companion had taken the horses to some
little distance to graze; the boy and the dog remained with him; he
had made a fire, and was in the act of preparing some dried meat to
be cooked, when the boy called out “where is the dog,”&mdash;the man
answered “here he is, why what is the matter?” the boy said, “what
eyes, then, are those?” pointing, at the same time, to the corner of
the rock; the man looked, and saw the eyes, for nothing else was to
be seen; he called to the dog, took up his fowling-piece, and fired,
whilst the dog started up, and darted towards the spot. A jaguar
rushed out, and made off; it had been partly concealed under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
rock, which, with the dazzle of the fire had prevented its body from
being seen; it had crouched, and was ready for a spring, when every
thing was quiet, and unprepared.</p>

<p>I learnt, that there are some extensive salt-works at the mouth of
the Açu, and that small craft come from different parts of the coast
occasionally, to carry away the overplus.</p>

<p>I took an additional guide here, as the man I had brought with me
from Goiana was not acquainted with the remainder of the road; but
I kept him with me, for although he was not a person I liked, still he
was master of his employment; he managed the horses well, for they
had, through his attention and knowledge of this business, all arrived
here without sore backs, which I found, from the surprise expressed
by all those who saw them, was not a usual piece of good fortune, or
good management. He was, however, a great bully, when we quartered
ourselves in the houses of poor people, with whom he found he
could so act with impunity: he was also continually reporting, that I
was a great personage, that he might increase his own importance.
Of this I said nothing; but on our return, whilst I was unwell, he
gave himself out as the chief of the party, which I once caught him
in the act of doing; I disconcerted him, by threatening to turn him
out of my service; and when I recovered, he took care to draw in, and
be more careful who overheard him. The additional man I took
with me, was a dark-coloured mulatto, young and stout; his father
lived at Açu, and this son had a fair character. He brought with
him a beautiful dog, which I afterwards possessed.</p>

<p>The next day, Julio came with the horses; and between three and
four o’clock in the afternoon, we left Açu.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<p class="pch">CONTINUATION OF THE JOURNEY.&mdash;FROM AÇU TO ARACATI.&mdash;FROM ARACATI
TO SEARA.&mdash;INDIANS.&mdash;THE LATE GOVERNOR.&mdash;THE FAMILY OF THE
FEITOZAS.</p>

<p class="drop-cap06">OUR way was through woodlands for about one league, when we
came out upon the borders of the lake Piatô; we proceeded
along them for another half league, and unloaded near to the
<i>caza de palha</i>, or straw cottage, of the commandant of the district.
Piatô is a lake of three leagues in length, and about one league in
breadth. In the summer its sides become sufficiently dry to enable
them to be cultivated, but the centre of it is invariably marshy and impassable.
The fertility of its sides is very great, affording most plentifully
rice, maize, sugar cane, melons, &amp;c. and I saw some cotton trees planted
very near to the edge. The lake is filled from the river in the rainy
season, and as the lands around it are much higher than the lake
itself, the waters which run down from them wash away all vestiges
of cultivation, till these again subside and the same operations are continued
the following season. In such dreadfully severe years as that
during which I travelled, the people of the district would be starved
if this lake did not exist; it enabled the inhabitants of Açu, at the
time I was there, to remain in their houses. The appearance of
abundance, the bright green, the well fed horses and cattle, which
we saw as we travelled along its banks, enlivened us all; there was a
look of security, a seeming certainty of at least the necessaries of life
let what would happen, which we had not for a long time felt. The
parched hills which surround the lake, its beautifully cultivated borders,
and the dark and dangerous bogs which compose its centre and
prevent the communication of the inhabitants of either bank, formed
a very extraordinary scene. No water was to be seen, but the mud<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
was too deep, and not of sufficient consistence for a man to be
enabled to wade across; nor could a passage to the other side be
effected by means of a raft, for a very trifling weight would make
it sink.</p>

<p>We unloaded under a small tree on rising ground, with the lake
on our right; between us and the house of the commandant, there was
a deep ravine, down which, in the rainy season, the waters rush from
the hills. This ravine was under cultivation and was inclosed, a narrow
path only being left to cross from where we had stationed ourselves
to the hut on the opposite hill, which was entirely composed
of wood and the leaves of the Carnaùba and other kinds of cabbage
trees. This was only a temporary habitation for the summer months,
the usual residence of the owner being at Açu. He had a large
family, who were all very shy, indeed the females I scarcely saw,
though they sometimes did peep at the Englishmen, not knowing
until now, that these were truly and <i>bona fide</i> nothing but men.</p>

<p>I was this afternoon surprised at a feat of dexterity of one of the
commandant’s sons, a boy of about fourteen years of age. I had
often heard of the manner of catching the wild cattle in the Sertam;
the person employed for the purpose pursues on horseback, with a
long pole, having a goad at one end, the animal which he is desirous
of bringing to the ground, until he overtakes it&mdash;he then pierces its
side between the ribs and the hip-bone, which, if it is done at the
moment the beast raises its hind feet from the ground, throws it
with such violence, as sometimes to make it roll over. Some oxen
had often trespassed upon the commandant’s maize; one of the boys
could no longer bear this quietly, he therefore mounted one of his
father’s horses, of which there were several very fine ones, took one
of the long poles and set off without a saddle, and in his shirt and
drawers, to attack the animals. He drove them out of the maize,
reached one of them with the goad at the right moment and
threw it down, but before he could turn his horse, another had
attacked him, running his horns into the fleshy part of one of the
horse’s thighs. The boy had taken the precaution of putting a bridle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
on to his horse, otherwise, if he had mounted with a halter only, he
would most probably have suffered much more. One of his brothers
came to his assistance, and drove the oxen quite away. The
facility with which the beast was thrown, proved that practice and
quickness were more requisite than strength in this operation.</p>

<p>Towards the evening a shower of rain came on, being the first
we had had since we left Goiana, and indeed this was the only rain
which fell during my journey between Goiana and Seara. However
there is not usually much wet weather at this season of the year; the
distress occasioned by the want of it, arose from the failure of the
accustomed rains in the preceding winter. We removed to the hut
across the ravine, leaving the greatest part of our baggage under the
tree, but the shower did not continue long. The hut was too small
to admit of our taking up our lodging for the night in it, and in case
of rain the tree was too far from the hut to reach it in time to prevent
being wet, for which reason I determined to sleep in the ravine
close to the fence, at the foot of the hill upon which the hut stood.
I made a bed for myself upon two packages, to windward of the fire
which we had kindled, but multitudes of mosquitos rose about midnight,
which obliged me to remove and lie down upon a hide to
leeward; the fire was mostly composed of the dried ordure of cattle,
the smoke from which is so thick and pungent as to prevent entirely
any annoyance from these troublesome insects, but the remedy is bad
enough, as it is almost impossible to open your eyes or to speak. The
misery of being exposed to the myriads of mosquitos which hovered
around us this night, made us chuse the smoke as the more endurable
evil. Notwithstanding these inconveniences we had some amusement
at the distress of him whose fire was allowed to burn low; none of us
slept much, for attention to the fires obliged every one to be on the
alert. Towards morning the smoke was scarcely sufficient to protect
us from these tormenting insects. I now learnt that near to
any lake or pool of water, the highest ground is always to be fixed
upon for a night station; even the commandant upon the hill had
fires to windward of the house during the whole of the night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>Early in the morning we continued our journey for some distance
along the banks of the lake, and then entered upon some open
land, which was now quite dry; we slept under a clump of trees,
distant about twenty miles from Piatô. The cattle we saw this day,
were in good condition, plainly showing, that the country enjoyed a
plentiful supply of water.</p>

<p>The road of the next day led us through woodlands, and over loose
stony ground; but the woods of this part of the country are not large
and luxuriant; they have not the grandeur of the forests of Pernambuco,
nor is the brushwood which grows under them so close and
thick. We passed through some estates, of which the live stock
seemed in good condition; and saw this day a whole drove or lot (<i>lote</i>)
of cream-coloured mares. I asked for water to drink at one of the
houses; some was brought to me by a pretty white girl, who was apparently
about seventeen years of age; she talked a great deal, and in a
lively manner, so as to show that she had inhabited more civilized
regions. There were in the house two children of colour, which she told
me were her’s; she was the daughter of a man of small property, who
had married her contrary to her wishes, to a wealthy mulatto man.
She gave a message to the guide to deliver to her husband, who was
superintending the felling of some timber by the road side, along
which we were to pass; we met with him, he was of dark complexion,
and about forty years of age. I learnt her story from the
Açu guide; he said, it had made some noise in these parts at the
time. In the afternoon we passed over a salt marsh, surrounded by
great numbers of carnàûba trees. We bordered the marsh, looking
for a crossing and entered it, where we found the footsteps of others
who had recently passed; the mud was from twelve to eighteen
inches deep where we crossed; but it was in some parts impassable.
The salt had coagulated wherever the footstep of a horse had formed
an opening in the mud, and had collected a small quantity of water.
The breadth of the marsh might be about two hundred yards in the
centre, and its length about one league. After leaving the marsh,
we reached the <i>taboleiro</i>, upon which we were to sleep. Towards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
evening, the wind was high. I was riding as if I had been seated upon
a side-saddle, with both my legs on the same side of the horse, and
with my umbrella over my head to shade me from the heat of the
sun; a sudden gust of wind took me and my umbrella, and landed
us in the sand, to the no small entertainment of my companions. If
the horse had gone off, I should have been awkwardly situated; but
he had travelled too many leagues to be frightened at trifles such
as these.</p>

<p>We continued travelling for two days over the same kind of
ground; plains with trees thinly scattered, and spots of wooded land.
We likewise crossed two salt marshes; but upon these there was no
mud. The water which oozes from the land, on digging into it, is
however, salt; but the soil was dry and hard. Mimoza, the dog
belonging to my new guide, afforded us considerable amusement.
She generally made her way through the wood at a little distance
from the road, now and then returning to the path. She was very
expert in discovering the <i>tatu bola</i>, or rolling <i>tatu</i>, a small species of
armadillo; this animal is protected by its bony shell; on being touched,
it rolls itself up in the manner of the hedge-hog. As soon as the
dog saw one of these, she touched it with her nose, and barked, continuing
the same operation as often as the armadillo attempted to
move, until her master answered the well-known signal. Several
were caught in this manner. The flesh is as fine as that of a young
pig. The <i>tatu verdadeiro</i>, or legitimate armadillo, which is much
larger, does not roll itself up, and Mimoza sometimes pursued it to
its hole, and stood at the mouth of it, until she had her master’s permission
to come away. There exists a third species of armadillo,
called the <i>tatu peba</i>, which is said to feed upon human flesh.</p>

<p>On the 7th December, we arrived at ten o’clock in the morning at
the village of St. Luzia, containing from two to three hundred inhabitants.
It is built in a square, and has one church; the houses
are small and low. Here I was able to replenish my spirit bottles,
and to purchase a supply of <i>rapaduras</i>. These are cakes of brown
sugar or treacle, boiled to a sufficient consistency to harden, by which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
means it is more portable, and much less liable to be wasted in its
conveyance.</p>

<p>The day before we reached St. Luzia, our resting place at mid-day
was under some trees, and not far from a cottage. I observed
the skin of a jaguar, the <i>onça pintada</i>, in the language of the country,
stretched upon several pieces of wood; it had the appearance of
being quite fresh. I had afterwards some conversation with the cottager,
and he told me, that he had killed the animal to which the
skin had belonged, with the assistance of three dogs, only the
day before. It had committed great destruction, particularly
among the sheep; but had escaped for a length of time, from never
appearing at the same place twice successively. The preceding day
this man had gone out with his three dogs, as was occasionally his
practice; his musket was loaded, but he was without any farther supply
of ammunition, and he had his long knife in his girdle. One of the
dogs got scent of the jaguar, and followed it up to the den; the beast
was within, the dogs attacked it; one of them was killed, and
another much maimed, which we saw, and even the third was hurt.
The man fired as soon as the jaguar came out, and wounded it; and
when he saw that it was considerably disabled, he ran in upon the
animal with his knife, and killed it; in doing which, one of his arms
was much lacerated, and this was bound up at the time I conversed
with him. He asked for some powder, saying that there was still another
jaguar in the neighbourhood. The skins are much valued in Brazil
for saddle-cloths; and from the make of the saddles used in that
country, a cloth of some sort, or a skin is required for each. I have
the skin of a jaguar in my possession, which measures five feet and
three inches. The <i>onça vermelha</i>, <i>felis concolor</i>, and the <i>onça preta</i>,
<i>felis discolor</i>, are also to be met with; but the jaguar is more common,
and more dreaded than either of these.</p>

<p>The same day we passed over the dry bed of the Panema;
it was the third river we had crossed since our departure from Açu,
and all were in the same state.</p>

<p>St. Luzia stands upon the northern bank of a dry river, in a sandy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
loose soil. We took up our mid-day station under the roof of a
miserable hut; the ashes of an extinguished fire in its centre, and a
bench of twisted twigs, alone denoted that it had served as a dwelling.
Several of the inhabitants of the village soon came to us to
enquire for news from Pernambuco; and among others, a young man,
whose accent discovered him to be a native of some of the northern
provinces of Portugal, and whose manner displayed the idea which
he entertained of his own importance; he said, that he had orders
from the commandant to demand my passport, to which I answered,
that if the commandant had wished to see the passport, he would certainly
have sent one of his officers to ask for it; the young man rejoined,
that he was the sergeant of the district. I said that I did not
doubt the truth of what he said, but that I could not know him in
that capacity, because, instead of being in uniform, he had appeared
in the usual dress of shirt and drawers; and I added, that his manner
was such, that I had quite resolved not to show it to him at all. He
said, I must and should show it; I turned to Julio, and asked him, if he
heard what the man said; Julio answered, “Yes, sir, never mind.”<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>
The sergeant went off, and we prepared our arms, much to the amazement
and amusement of some of the more peaceable inhabitants.
I soon saw him again, and he was coming towards us, with two or
three other persons; I called to him to keep at a distance, telling
him that Julio would fire if he did not. This he judged advisable to
do; and as I thought it proper and prudent to advance as soon as
possible, we left the place soon after one o’clock, with a broiling sun;
therefore we then saw no more of the sergeant. The dry river, upon
which this village stands, divides the captaincies of Rio Grande and
Seara, consequently there was much reason for the commandant’s
demand of my passport; but it was necessary to preserve the high
opinion generally entertained of the name of <i>Inglez</i>, Englishman,
wherever the people possessed sufficient knowledge to understand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
that the said <i>Inglezes</i>, were not <i>bichos</i>, or animals; and also to keep
up my own importance with the persons about me. It would not
have answered, to have thus given way to a man who was inclined
to make me feel the consequence which he judged his place would
allow him to assume. If I had been invited to the commandant’s
house in a civil way, or if the sergeant had come to me in his uniform,
all would have gone well. These trifles, though apparently of
no importance, weigh very heavily with persons who have made
such small advances towards civilization; public opinion is every
thing. If the idea of my being a <i>bicho</i> and a heretic had not been
counter-balanced by that of rank and consequence, I might have
had the whole village upon me, and have been deserted by my own
people into the bargain.</p>

<p>The general features of the captaincy of Rio Grande, may be laid
down as displaying tolerable fertility to the southward of Natal, and
as having a barren aspect to the northward of it, excepting the banks
and immediate neighbourhood of the Potengi.</p>

<p>We passed through the estate of Ilha, distant from St. Luzia one
league and a half, and proceeded, after taking water, four leagues
beyond it, to an uninhabited and unfinished house. The owner had
commenced building during the rains of the former year, and had
gone on with the work until the spring of water, near to the place,
failed. The house was tiled and spacious; but the wood work only
of the walls was erected. It had been the intention of this person to
establish a <i>fazenda</i> here; but the failure of the spring of water would,
probably, deter him from his purpose. The country from Ilha to
Tibou, where we halted at noon on the following day, a distance of
ten leagues, was now without water. Two parties of travellers,
besides our own, had taken up their night’s lodging at this unfinished
house. The several fires, the groups around them, some cooking,
some eating, and others asleep; the pack-saddles and trunks strewed
about, as they had been taken from the horses’ backs, formed a scene
worthy of a painter; all was darkness around, and the wind blew
fresh, for the house had no walls, and no obstruction to oppose its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
entrance, save the upright posts which supported the roof. The light
of the fires sometimes flashed upon one or other of the countenances
of the travellers, and on these occasions alone could I discover their
colour and consequently, in some degree, their rank. I might be in
the company of slaves or of white men, for both would have taken up
their night’s station in the same manner. An old man of colour
addressed me, asking if I was the Englishman who had rested at noon
at St. Luzia; on my answering in the affirmative, he said that he was
at the commandant’s at the time, and that there were several debates
about the mode of proceeding respecting me and mine&mdash;that my
determination not to give up my passport had caused some demur, and
that among other suppositions of who I might be, one wiseacre
said, there was no knowing whether I was not one of Bonaparte’s
ministers, and what might be my diabolical plans. Indeed I was often
amused with the strange ideas which the country people entertained
of distant nations, of which they had heard the names, and perhaps
some further particulars; these were altered in such a manner by
their misapprehension, that it was oftentimes difficult to discover
what the real circumstances were which had been related to them.</p>

<p>We traversed another salt marsh this afternoon. The marsh I
have mentioned as having crossed on the 4th of this month, was the
only one of that description which I met with. The others I have
spoken of, and those which I shall have occasion to mention, are dry,
and the soil upon them in summer is hard, it is dark coloured and
produces no grass, but upon the skirts of the marshes are seen several
sea-side plants, and the water that oozes from them is quite salty.</p>

<p>Our road the next morning lay through brushwood for three
leagues over heavy sand, and three leagues over a salt marsh. Near
mid-day we passed a cottage, in which resided the herdsman of a
<i>fazenda</i> and immediately beyond, ascended a hill of heavy sand called
Tibou, from which we again saw the sea. I scarcely can describe the
sensations which were occasioned by this sight; I felt as if I was at
home, as if free to act as I pleased. The spring of water near to the
cottage was dried up, but there was one on the opposite side of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
sand-hill, which still afforded a small supply; we now took up our
mid-day station under a miserable hut, erected at the summit of the
hill, by the inhabitants of the cottage, for the purpose of curing their
fish; they had fixed upon this spot from its height and consequent
exposure to the wind. The descent to the sea-shore is steep, but not
dangerous, as the depth of the sand prevents any apprehension of a
horse falling and rolling down. The great length of the journies of
the two last days, had almost knocked up the horse upon which my
Goiana guide rode; I saw that the man was not inclined to walk
for the purpose of easing the animal, and therefore wishing to see
what could be done by example, I dismounted and took off the greatest
part of my cloaths, removed the bit from my horse’s mouth, tied
the bridle round his neck, and turned him loose among the others;
this had the desired effect, and John also was then ashamed to be
the only person on horseback.</p>

<p>We advanced very quickly over the wet sands, passed two fishermen’s
huts distant from Tibou two leagues; and one league further
turned up from the shore by a steep, sandy path, which took us to the
hamlet of Areias, composed of one respectable looking dwelling and
five or six straw huts. The lands we passed this afternoon, bordering
the shore, are low and sandy, without trees and without cultivation.
In seasons less severe than this there is a small spring of water, not far
from the fishermen’s huts which we had passed, but now it was entirely
dried up; they stand near to a small piece of ground, of which the soil
is less sandy than that in the neighbourhood, and a crop of water
melons is usually obtained from it, which had however completely
failed this year. On our arrival at Areias I made for the principal
house, and asked for a night’s lodging. The front room was offered to
me, upon which our horses were unloaded, and our baggage put into
it. I was surprised to see no elderly or middle aged person belonging
to this house; there were three or four boys only, of whom the oldest
was about sixteen years of age, and he appeared to direct the concerns
of the establishment. He had a piece of inclosed ground near to the
house, into which he allowed our horses to be turned, and this arrangement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
being made, I had then time to look round, and see my quarters.
Not a tree or shrub was to be seen in the neighbourhood, but there
were immense sand-hills on one side, and on the other the sea. The
convenience of the spot for fishing could alone have made these people
fix upon it for a residence. I sent out to purchase a fowl; one was
brought, for which I paid 640 <i>reis</i>, about 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> Julio told me that he
had seen some goats and kids, upon which I sent him to purchase
one of the latter; he returned with a large one, for which the owner
asked 80 <i>reis</i>, less than 6<i>d.</i> I thought I was in duty bound to eat
my fowl, but the kid was much finer of its kind. A boy passed in
the evening with a large turtle, which he begged the guide to exchange
for about one pound of the kid; the meat was given to him, but
his turtle would have been of no use to us.</p>

<p>Julio, when he went to purchase the kid, had heard a long story
about a ghost, which made its appearance in the house at which we
had stationed ourselves. The persons from whom he heard it, had
advised him to make me acquainted with the circumstance, that I
might move to some other place for the night. I began to suspect
some trick, and told my people my idea of the sort of ghost we were
likely to meet with; I found that this cheered them, as by them shadows
were more dreaded than flesh and blood. We slung our hammocks
in different directions in the large room, and each took his
arms, and settled for the night;&mdash;a sudden panic seized my additional
guide, and he was sneaking out of the room; but I stopped him, and
said, that I would send him back to his own country if he went out;
the business was however settled by taking the key from the door.
The story ran thus, the master and mistress of the house had been
murdered by two of their slaves, and it was said that their ghosts
occasionally took a walk in this room; nay, it was even reported that
the old gentleman used his gold headed cane, and woke with it
those who slept in the house. We had not, however, the honour
of his company, and in the morning had much laughter, at the
fellow who had been so dreadfully frightened.</p>

<p>The country through which we proceeded on the morrow, presented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
a more cheering appearance. We reached, at a short distance
from Areias, some inclosed and cultivated lands, then passed
over a salt-marsh and arrived at Cajuaes, distant from Areias two
leagues. The place receives its name from the great number of
acaju trees, and consists of six or seven huts. Here we dined, finding
good water and abundance of maize-stalks for our horses. There
was some appearance of comfort and enjoyment of life, at least
comparatively speaking. Beyond Cajuaes three leagues we slept
near to a hut, after travelling through some more cultivated ground.
I was asked, by some persons at Cajuaes, at what place I had slept the
preceding night; I answered at Areias, they then enquired in what
house at Areias, as at that village there was none into which travellers
could be received. I replied, that on the contrary, there was
the great house, which I had found very comfortable; they were perfectly
astonished at my sleeping in this haunted place, and for some
time imagined that I was joking. Afterwards, on other occasions, I
heard of the same story, which appeared to have taken deep root
in the faith of all those who spoke of it.</p>

<p>The next day we reached Aracati, distant seven leagues from where
we had slept, about five o’clock in the afternoon. Great part of this
day’s journey was through salt marshes or plains covered with the
Carnàûba; the tall naked stems of the palms, crowned with branches
like the coco tree at the summit, which rustle with the least breath
of air, and the bare and dark coloured soil upon which no grass
grows and rarely any shrub, give a dismal look to these plains.
The computed distance from Açû? to Aracati is forty-five leagues.
When I approached Aracati, I sent my Goiana guide forwards with
the letter which I had received from the governor of Rio Grande to
Senhor Joze Fideles Barrozo, a wealthy merchant and landed proprietor.
On my arrival, I found that the guide had delivered the
letter, and that Senhor Barrozo had given to him the keys of an unoccupied
house, which I was to inhabit during my stay.</p>

<p>The town of Aracati consists chiefly of one long street, with several
others of minor importance branching from it to the southward; it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
stands upon the southern bank of the river Jaguaribe, which is so far
influenced by the tide. At the ebb, the stream is fordable, and as it
spreads considerably from the main channel, some parts remain quite
dry at low water. The houses of Aracati, unlike those of any of
the other small places which I visited, have one story above the
ground floor; I enquired the reason of this, and was told, that the
floods of the river were sometimes so great, as to render necessary a
retreat to the upper part of the houses. The town contains three
churches, and a town-hall and prison, but no monasteries; this captaincy
does not contain any such pest. The inhabitants are in number
about six hundred.</p>

<p>The house I was to occupy, consisted of two good sized rooms,
with large closets or small bed-chambers leading from each, called
<i>alcovas</i>, and a kitchen, these were all above; and underneath there
was a sort of warehouse. To the back we had an oblong yard, inclosed
by a brick wall, with a gate at the farther end, by which our
horses entered; and here they remained until better arrangements
could be made for them. I slung my hammock in the front room,
and desired that some fowls should be purchased, as stock, whilst we
remained here. One was preparing for me, when three black
servants appeared from Senhor Barrozo; the first brought a large
tray with a plentiful and excellently cooked supper, wine, sweetmeats,
&amp;c.&mdash;a second carried a silver ewer and basin, and a fringed
towel, and a third came to know if there was any thing which I particularly
wished for, besides what had been prepared; this man took
back my answer, and the other two remained to attend, until I had
supped. I learnt from the guide afterwards, that another tray had
been sent for my people. I supposed that Senhor Barrozo had
thought proper to treat me in this manner on the day of my arrival,
from an idea that I could not have arranged any means of cooking,
&amp;c. until the next day; but in the morning coffee and cakes were
brought to me, and the same major-domo came to know if all was
to my liking. Whilst I remained at Aracati, Senhor Barrozo provided
every thing for me and for my people, in the same handsome<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
manner. This treatment is usual where persons are well recommended;
it is noble, and shows the state of manners among the
higher orders.</p>

<p>In the morning I received a visit from Senhor Barrozo, whose manners
were ceremonious and courtly. On my mentioning the inconvenience
to which I was putting him by my stay, he said, that he could
not alter in any way his mode of treating me, because, if he did, he
should not do his duty to the governor of Rio Grande, to whom he
owed many obligations, and, consequently, took every opportunity of
showing his gratitude by all the means in his power. The reason which
he thus gave for his civility, completely set at rest any thing I could
have said to prevent its continuance. He ordered all my horses to
be taken to an island in the river, upon which there was plenty of
grass. I had resolved to send John back to Pernambuco by sea, and
spoke to Senhor Barrozo upon the subject, when he immediately said,
that one of his smacks was going, in which my servant might have a
birth. John was out of health, and not adapted to the kind of life
which we had been leading, and should be yet under the necessity
of continuing. This day I remained at home, employing the greatest
part of it in sleeping; and in the evening returned Senhor Barrozo’s
visit. A white man, with whom my Goiana guide was
acquainted, called upon me, and we arranged an expedition in a
canoe, for the next day, to go down the river to its mouth.</p>

<p>My guide’s friend came as he had appointed, and his canoe was
waiting for us. His two negroes poled where the water was shallow,
and paddled us along where it became deep. We passed several beautiful
islands, some of which had cattle upon them; and others, of which
the land was too low to produce grass; the latter were entirely covered
with mangroves, which grow likewise on the borders of the river, the
shores being clear of them only where settlements are formed, and
the proprietors have extirpated them. The river is, in parts, about half
a mile in breadth, and in some places, where there are islands, it is
broader, if taken from the outermost sides of the two branches which
it, in these situations, forms. The town is distant from the bar about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
eight miles. We boarded Senhor Barrozo’s smack, took the long
boat belonging to it, and proceeded to the bar, which is narrow and
dangerous, owing to the sand banks on each side; upon these the
surf is very violent. The sand is so loose at the mouth of the river,
that the masters of the coasting vessels are obliged to use every precaution
possible each voyage, as if they were entering a harbour with
which they are unacquainted. The river widens immediately within
the bar, and forms rather a spacious bay. Even if no other obstacle
presented itself, the port cannot, from the uncertainty of the depth
of its entrance, ever become of any importance. Coasters alone can
enter, and I understand that the sand in the river also accumulates;
the sand banks project from each side in some places so much as
to render the navigation, even for a boat, somewhat difficult from a
short distance above the bay<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>. On our return, we dined at an estate
upon the banks of the river, of which the owner was an acquaintance
of the man who had proposed this party. Opposite to the dwelling-house
of this estate stands an island, which produces abundance of
grass; but there is no fresh water upon it; this obliges the cattle that
feed there, regularly to pass over to the main land every day to drink,
and return to the island, which they are so much accustomed to do,
that no herdsman is necessary to compel them. We saw them swim
across, and all passed close to the house in their way to the pool.
The owner said, that the calves invariably took that side of their
mothers to which the tide was running, to prevent being carried
away by the force of the stream: and indeed I observed, that all the
calves took the same side.</p>

<p>In the evening arrangements were made for the hire of two horses
to carry me and one of my people to Seara, leaving my own beasts
to rest for the journey back to Pernambuco. I again called upon
Senhor Barrozo, to make known to him my plan, and he then gave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
me a letter to a gentleman with whom he was acquainted at Seara.
A guide for the journey was also procured.</p>

<p>The horses were ready, and in the morning I set forth, accompanied
by my Goiana guide, and the man whom I had hired for this
additional journey; he rode a horse with which he had been charged
to take to Seara. He was an old man, half mad, and very amusing.
We hailed the ferryman to take us across the river before day-break;
but as he did not answer, we took possession of a large canoe
which lay empty, and was tied to a post; we got into it, and the
Goiana guide paddled us very dexterously to the middle of the river,
where the canoe grounded; it had struck upon a sand bank, owing to
the man being unacquainted with the navigation of the stream. We
were obliged to undress, and get into the water to push the canoe off,
which we succeeded in doing, and reached the opposite side in safety.
The horses crossed over, tied to the sides of the canoe, swimming or
taking the ground according to the depth of the water.</p>

<p>The distance between Aracati and the <i>Villa da Fortaleza do Seara
Grande</i>, is thirty leagues, principally consisting of sandy lands covered
with brushwood; in a few places, the wood is loftier and thicker, but
of this there is not much. We passed also some fine <i>varseas</i>, or low
marshy grounds, which were now sufficiently dry for cultivation; and
indeed the only land from which any crop could be expected in this
particularly severe dry season. The country is, generally speaking,
flat, and in some parts the path led us near to the sea shore, but was
never upon it. We saw several cottages, and three or four hamlets;
the facility of obtaining fish from the sea, has rendered living comparatively
easy in these parts. We passed through an Indian village,
and the town of St. Joze, each built in a square, and each containing
about three hundred inhabitants. I understood that the governors
of Seara are obliged to take possession of their office at St. Joze. We
made the journey in four days, arriving at the <i>Villa da Fortaleza</i> on
the 16th December, and might have entered it at noon on the fourth
day, but I preferred waiting until the evening. I performed the
journey from Natal to Seara, a distance of one hundred and sixty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
leagues, according to the vague computation of the country, in thirty-four
days. The morning after my arrival I sent back to Aracati the
men and horses which I had brought with me.</p>

<p>The town of the fortress of Searà is built upon heavy sand, in the
form of a square, with four streets leading from it, and it has an additional
long street on the north side of the square, which runs in a parallel
direction, but is unconnected with it. The dwellings have only a
ground floor, and the streets are not paved; but some of the houses
have foot paths of brick in front. It contains three churches, the
governor’s palace, the town-hall and prison, a custom-house, and
the treasury. The number of inhabitants I judge to be from one
thousand to twelve hundred. The fort, from which the place derives
its name, stands upon a sand-hill close to the town, and consists of a
sand or earth rampart towards the sea, and of stakes driven into the
ground on the land side; it contained four or five pieces of cannon of
several sizes, which were pointed various ways; and I observed that
the gun of heaviest metal was mounted on the land side. Those which
pointed to the sea were not of sufficient calibre to have reached a vessel
in the usual anchorage ground. The powder magazine is situated
upon another part of the sand-hill, in full view of the harbour. There
is not much to invite the preference given to this spot; it has no
river, nor any harbour, and the beach is bad to land upon; the
breakers are violent, and the <i>recife</i> or reef of rocks affords very little
protection to vessels riding at anchor upon the coast. The settlement
was formerly situated three leagues to the northward, upon a
narrow creek, where there exists now only the remains of an old fort.
The beach is steep, which renders the surf dangerous for a boat to
pass through in making for the shore. A vessel unloaded during
my stay there, and part of her cargo consisted of the flour of the
mandioc in small bags; the long boat approached as near to the
shore as it could without striking, and the bags were landed on men’s
heads; the persons employed to bring them ashore passed through
the surf with them; but if they were caught by a wave the flour was
wetted and injured, and indeed few reached the shore perfectly dry.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
The anchorage ground is bad and exposed; the winds are always
from the southward and eastward; and if they were very variable a
vessel could scarcely ride upon the coast. The reef of rocks forms a
complete ridge, at a considerable distance from the shore, and is to
be seen at low water. Upon this part of the coast the reef runs
lower than towards Pernambuco, which has obliged the people of
Searà to take advantage of the rocks being rather higher here, and
affording some little protection to ships at anchor. The spot seems to
have been preferred owing to this advantage, trifling as it is, though the
rocks are much inferior to those which form the bold reef of Pernambuco.
The ridge runs parallel with the shore for about one quarter of a
mile, with two openings, one above and the other below the town.
A small vessel may come to anchor between it and the shore; but a
large ship can only bring up either to the northward or to the southward
of the town, in one of the openings of the ridge or on the outside
of it. The opening to the northward is to be preferred. A
vessel coming from the northward should make the point of
Mocoripe, which lies one league to the southward of the town, and
upon it stands a small fort; this being done, she will then be able to
make the anchorage ground. On the appearance of a ship the fort
of the town will have a white flag flying upon a high flag-staff. To
the northward of the town, between the reef and the shore, there is a
rock called <i>Pedra da Velha</i>, or the Old Woman’s Rock, which is to
be seen even at high water by the breakers upon it. When a vessel
leaves the port she may either pass between this rock and the shore,
giving a birth to a shoal about one hundred yards to the northward,
or she may run between the rock and the principal ridge or reef.</p>

<p>The public buildings are small and low, but are neat and white-washed,
and adapted to the purposes for which they are intended.
Notwithstanding the disadvantage to the general appearance, imparted
by the wretched soil upon which the town has been erected,
I could not avoid thinking that its look was that of a thriving place;
but I believe that this can scarcely be said to be the real state of the
town. The difficulty of land carriage, particularly in such a country,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
the want of a good harbour, and the dreadful droughts, prevent any
sanguine hope of its rise to opulence. The commerce of Searà is
very limited and is not likely to increase; the long credits which
it is necessary for the trader to give, preclude the hope of quick
returns, to which British merchants are accustomed.</p>

<p>I rode immediately on my arrival to the house of Senhor Marcos
Antonio Briçio, the chief of the Treasury and of the Naval department,
with several other titles which are not transferrable into our
language; to this gentleman I had a letter of introduction from
Senhor Barrozo. I found several persons assembled at his house to
drink tea and play at cards. Senhor Marcos is an intelligent and
well-informed man, who has seen good society in Lisbon, and had
held a high situation at Maranham before he was appointed to
Searà. I was introduced to Senhor Lourenço, a merchant, who had
connections in trade with England; he recognized my name, for he
had been acquainted with near relations of mine in Lisbon. I was
invited to stay with him and received from him every civility.</p>

<p>The morning after my arrival I visited the governor, Luiz Barba
Alardo de Menezes<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>, and was received by him with much affability;
he said, that he wished he had more opportunities of shewing the
regard which he entertained for my countrymen, and that some of
them would come and settle in his captaincy. He built, during his
administration of the province, the centre of the palace, and employed
Indian workmen, paying them half the usual price of labour. He
was in the habit of speaking of the property of individuals residing
within the province as if it was his own, saying, his ships, his cotton,
&amp;c. I happened to be at Searà, on the Queen of Portugal’s birthday;
the company of regular troops, consisting of one hundred and
fourteen men, was reviewed; they looked respectable, and were in
tolerable order. In the chief apartment of the palace stood a full
length picture of the Prince Regent of Brazil, which was placed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
against the wall, and was raised about three feet from the ground.
Three or four steps ascended from the floor to the foot of the picture;
upon the lowest of these the governor stood in full uniform, and
each person passed before him and bowed, that thus the state of the
Sovereign Court might be kept up. I dined with the governor this
day, at whose table were assembled all the military and civil officers,
and two or three merchants; he placed me at his right hand, as a
stranger, thus shewing the estimation in which Englishmen are held.
About thirty persons were present at the table, of which more than
half wore uniforms; indeed the whole display was much more brilliant
than I had expected; every thing was good and handsome.</p>

<p>I had opportunities of seeing the Indian villages of Aronxas and
Masangana, and there is a third in this neighbourhood, of which I
have forgotten the name; each is distant from Searà between two
and three leagues, in different directions; they are built in the form
of a square, and each contains about three hundred inhabitants. One
of my usual companions on these occasions was acquainted with the
vicar of Aronxas, and we therefore made him a visit. He resided in
a building which had formerly belonged to the Jesuits; it is attached
to the church, and has balconies from the principal corridor, which
look into it.</p>

<p>The Indians of these villages, and indeed of all those which I
passed through, are Christians; though it is said that some few of
them follow in secret their own heathenish rites, paying adoration to
the <i>maracà</i>, and practising all the customs of their religion, if I may
use this word, of which so exact a description is given in Mr.
Southey’s History of Brazil. When the Roman Catholic religion
does take root in them, it of necessity degenerates into the most
abject superstition. An adherence to superstitious rites, whether of
Roman Catholic ordination or prescribed by their own undefined
faith, appears to be the only part of their character in which they
shew any constancy. Each village has its priest, who is oftentimes
a vicar, and resident for life upon the spot. A director is also
attached to each village, who is supposed to be a white man; he has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
great power over the persons within his jurisdiction. If a proprietor
of land is in want of workmen he applies to the director, who agrees
for the price at which the daily labour is to be paid, and he commands
one of his chief Indians to take so many men and proceed
with them to the estate for which they are hired. The labourers
receive the money themselves, and expend it as they please; but the
bargains thus made are usually below the regular price of labour.
Each village has two <i>Juizes Ordinarios</i> or Mayors, who act for one
year. One <i>Juiz</i> is a white man, and the other an Indian; but it may
easily be supposed that the former has, in fact, the management.
These <i>Juizes</i> have the power of putting suspicious persons into confinement,
and of punishing for small crimes; those of more importance
wait for the <i>Correiçam</i>, or circuit of the <i>Ouvidor</i> of the captaincy.
Each village contains a town-hall and prison. The administration
of justice in the Sertam is generally spoken of as most
wretchedly bad; every crime obtains impunity by the payment of a
sum of money. An innocent person is sometimes punished through
the interest of a great man, whom he may have offended, and the
murderer escapes who has the good fortune to be under the protection
of a powerful patron. This proceeds still more from the feudal
state of the country than from the corruption of the magistrates, who
might often be inclined to do their duty, and yet be aware that their
exertions would be of no avail, and would possibly prove fatal to
themselves. The Indians have likewise their <i>Capitaens-mores</i>, and this
title is conferred for life; it gives the holder some power over his
fellows, but as it is among them, unaccompanied by the possession
of property, the Indian <i>Capitaens-mores</i> are much ridiculed by the
whites; and indeed the half naked officer with his gold-headed cane
is a personage who would excite laughter from the most rigid
nerves.</p>

<p>The Indians are in general a quiet and inoffensive people, they have
not much fidelity, but although they desert they will not injure those
whom they have served. Their lives are certainly not passed in a
pleasant manner under the eye of a director, by whom they are imperiously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
treated, consequently it is not surprising that they should
do all in their power to leave their villages and be free from an immediate
superior; but even when they have escaped from the irksome
dominion of the director they never settle in one place. The Indian
scarcely ever plants for himself, or if he does, rarely waits the
crop; he sells his maize or mandioc for half its value, before it is
fit to be gathered, and removes to some other district. His favourite
pursuits are fishing and hunting; a lake or rivulet will alone
induce him to be stationary for any length of time. He has a sort
of independent feeling, which makes him spurn at any thing like a
wish to deprive him of his own free agency; to the director he submits,
because it is out of his power to resist. An Indian can never
be persuaded to address the master to whom he may have hired
himself, by the term of Senhor, though it is made use of by the whites
in speaking to each other, and by all other free people in the
country; but the negroes also use it in speaking to their masters,
therefore the Indian will not; he addresses his temporary master by
the term of <i>amo</i> or <i>patram</i>, protector or patron. The reluctance to use
the term of Senhor may perhaps have commenced with the immediate
descendants of those who were in slavery, and thus the objection may
have become traditionary. They may refuse to give by courtesy
what was once required from them by law. However, if it began in
this manner, it is not now continued for the same reason, as none of
those with whom I conversed, and they were very many, appeared to
know that their ancestors had been obliged to work as slaves.</p>

<p>The instances of murder committed by Indians are rare. They are
pilferers rather than thieves. When they can, they eat immoderately;
but if it is necessary they can live upon a very trifling quantity of
food, to which their idleness often reduces them. They are much
addicted to liquor, and will dance in a ring, singing some of the
monotonous ditties of their own language, and drink for nights and
days without ceasing. Their dances are not indecent, as those of
Africa. The mulattos consider themselves superior to the Indians,
and even the Creole blacks look down upon them; “he is as paltry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
as an Indian<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>,” is a common expression among the lower orders in
Brazil. They are vilely indifferent regarding the conduct of their wives
and daughters; lying and other vices attached to savage life belong to
them. Affection seems to have little hold upon them; they appear
to be less anxious for the life and welfare of their children than any
other cast of men who inhabit that country. The women however
do not, among these semi-barbarians, perform the principal drudgery;
if the husband is at home he fetches water from the rivulet and
fuel from the wood; he builds the hut whilst his wife takes shelter
in some neighbour’s shed. But if they travel she has her young
children to carry, the pots, the baskets, and the excavated gourds,
whilst the husband takes his wallet of goat-skin and his hammock
rolled up upon his back, his fishing net and his arms, and walks in
the rear. The children are washed on the day of their birth in the
nearest brook or pool of water. Both the men and the women are
cleanly in many of their habits, and particularly in those relating to
their persons; but in some other matters their customs are extremely
disgusting; the same knife is used for all purposes, and with
little preparatory cleaning is employed in services of descriptions
widely opposite. They do not reject any kind of food, and devour it
almost without being cooked; rats and other small vermin, snakes
and alligators are all accepted.</p>

<p>The instinct, for I know not what else to call it, which the Indians
possess above other men, in finding their way across a wood to a
certain spot on the opposite side without path or apparent mark, is
most surprising; they trace footsteps over the dry leaves which lie
scattered under the trees. The letter-carriers, from one province to
another, are mostly Indians, for from habit they endure great fatigue,
and will walk day after day, with little rest, for months together. I
have met them with their wallets made of goat-skin upon their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
shoulders, walking at a regular pace, which is not altered by rough
or smooth. Though a horse may outstrip one of these men for the
first few days, still if the journey continues long, the Indian will, in
the end, arrive before him. If a criminal has eluded the diligence of
the police officers, Indians are sent in pursuit of him, as a last resource.
It is well known that they will not take him alive; each
man who sees the offender fires, for they do not wish to have any
contention. Nor is it possible for the magistrate to fix upon the
individual of the party who shot the criminal; for if any of them are
asked who killed him, the answer invariably is “<i>os homems</i>,” the men.</p>

<p>It is usually said, that a party of Indians will fight tolerably well;
but that two or three will take to their heels at the first alarm.
Some of them however are resolute, and sufficiently courageous;
but the general character is usually supposed to be cowardly, inconstant,
devoid of acute feelings, as forgetful of favours as of injuries,
obstinate in trifles, regardless of matters of importance. The character
of the negro is more decided; it is worse, but it is also better.
From the black race the worst of men may be formed; but they
are capable likewise of great and good actions. The Indian
seems to be without energy or exertion; devoid of great good or
great evil. Much may at the same time be said in their favour;
they have been unjustly dealt with, they have been trampled upon,
and afterwards treated as children; they have been always subjected
to those who consider themselves their superiors, and this desire to
govern them has even been carried to the direction of their domestic
arrangements. But no,&mdash;if they are a race of acute beings, capable
of energy, of being deeply interested upon any subject, they would
do more than they have done. The priesthood is open to them;
but they do not take advantage of it<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>. I never saw an Indian mechanic
in any of the towns; there is no instance of a wealthy Indian;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
rich mulattos and negroes are by no means rare. I have had many
dealings with them as guides and carriers, and subsequently as
labourers, and have no reason to complain, for I was never injured
by any of them; but neither did I receive any particular
good service, excepting in the instance of Julio. For guides and
carriers they are well adapted, as their usual habits lead them to the
rambling life which these employments encourage. As labourers, I
found that they had usually a great inclination to over-reach; but
their schemes were badly made, and consequently easily discovered.
I never could depend upon them for any length of time, and to advance
money or cloathing to them is a certain loss. If I had any labour
which was to be performed by a given time, the overseer would
always reckon upon his mulatto and negro free people; but did not
mention in the list of persons who were to work, any of the Indians
whom I was then employing; and on my speaking of them, he answered
“An Indian is only to be mentioned for the present day<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>,”
meaning that no reliance is to be placed upon them.</p>

<p>Like most of the aboriginal inhabitants of the western hemisphere,
these people are of a copper colour. They are short, and stoutly
made; but their limbs, though large, have not the appearance of
possessing great strength, they have no shew of muscle. The face is
disproportionately broad, the nose flat, the mouth wide, the eyes deep
and small, the hair black, coarse, and lank; none of the men have
whiskers, and their beards are not thick. The women, when they are
young, have by no means an unpleasant appearance; but they soon
fall off, and become ugly; their figures are seldom well shaped. Deformity
is rare among the Indians; I do not recollect to have seen
an individual of this race who had been born defective; and the
well-informed persons with whom I conversed were of opinion, that
the Indians are more fortunate in this respect than any other race with
whom they were acquainted. All the Indians of Pernambuco speak<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
Portugueze, but few of them pronounce it well; there is always a certain
twang which discovers the speaker to be an Indian, although the
voice was heard without the person being seen; many of them however
do not understand any other language. The Indians seldom
if ever speak Portugueze so well as the generality of the creole
negroes.</p>

<p>It must be perfectly understood, that although there may be some
unfair dealings occasionally of the director towards the Indian, still
this race cannot be enslaved; the Indian cannot be made to work for
any person against his inclination, he cannot be bought and sold.
An Indian will sometimes make over his child, when very young, to
a rich person to be taught some trade, or to be brought up as a
household servant, but as soon as the child is of an age to provide for
itself, it cannot be prevented from so doing; it may leave the person
under whose care it has been placed if it be so inclined.</p>

<p>Two Indians presented themselves at the gate of the Carmelite convent
of Goiana, and requested and were permitted to see the prior.
They put into his hands a purse containing several gold coins, saying
that they had found it near Dous Rios; they begged that he
would order a number of masses to be said in their behalf, which were
to be paid for from the contents of the purse. The prior, admiring
their honesty, asked one of them to remain with him as his servant,
to which the man agreed. The friar was in the habit of going into
the country to a friend’s house to shoot. On one occasion, after the
Indian had served him for some time, he left the convent and took
him on one of these expeditions, but when they were about half way,
the friar discovered that he had forgotten his powder-horn; he gave
the key of his trunk to the Indian and desired him to fetch the
powder whilst he proceeded. In vain he waited at his friend’s
house for his servant, and on his return to the convent in the evening
he heard that he was not there. He went immediately to his
cell, supposing that he had been robbed of all his money, and whatever
else the fellow could carry of; but to his joy he discovered on
examination, that the man had only taken the powder-horn, two silver<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
coins of about 4s. value each, an old clerical gown, and a pair of
worn out nankeen pantaloons. This story I had from an intimate
friend of the prior.</p>

<p>One of the days of my stay at Searà we passed upon the borders of
a lake, which is between two and three leagues distant from the town,
for the purpose of shooting. This lake was nearly dry. The general
feature of the country about Searà is arid; the captaincy produces
no sugar, but the lands are adapted for cotton, of which however the
crop this year was very trifling. So excessive had the drought become,
that a famine was feared, and great distress would have been experienced
if a vessel had not arrived from the southward laden with
the flour of the mandioc. The usual price of it was 640 <i>reis per
alqueire</i>, but the cargo of this vessel was sold at 6400 <i>reis per alqueire</i>;
a fact which proves the scarcity to have been very great. Formerly
considerable quantities of beef were salted and dried here, and were
exported to the other captaincies, but from the mortality among the
cattle, caused by the frequent dry seasons, this trade has been unavoidably
given up entirely, and the whole country is now supplied from
the Rio Grande do Sul, the southern boundary of the Portugueze
dominions. But the meat which arrives at Pernambuco from the
Rio Grande do Sul, still preserves its name of Searà meat, <i>carne do
Searà</i>. The country to the northward and eastward I understood to
be much superior to that in the neighbourhood of Searà. The captaincy
of Piauhi, which lies in that direction, is accounted fertile, and
is not subject to droughts.</p>

<p>Many were the praises which I heard of the late governor of Searà,
Joam Carlos, who was appointed to this province before he had
arrived at the age of twenty years, and who was at the time I visited
Searà captain-general of Mato Grosso. His administration of justice
was in general summary, but on one occasion he waved his usual
severity; he was informed, whilst playing at cards at the house of
Senhor Marcos, which is near to the palace, that a soldier was
robbing his garden. He answered, “Poor fellow, great must be his
hunger when he runs the risk of entering his governor’s garden&mdash;don’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
molest him.” Some persons were in the practice of taking
doors off their hinges, and other tricks of the same sort, during the
night; the governor had in vain attempted to discover who they
were, and he resolved at last to wrap himself up in his cloak and
to apprehend some of them, if possible, with his own hands. A young
man, with whom I was acquainted, had met the governor on one of
these nights, he demanded his name and, on discovering who it was,
admonished him to be at home at an earlier hour on the following
evening.</p>

<p>The family of the Feitozas still exists in the interior of this captaincy
and that of Piauhi, in possession of extensive estates, which are
covered with immense droves of cattle. In the time of Joam Carlos, the
chiefs had risen to such power, and were supposed to be so completely
out of the reach of punishment, that they entirely refused obedience
to the laws, both civil and criminal, such as they are. They revenged
their own wrongs; persons obnoxious to them were publicly murdered
in the villages of the interior; the poor man who refused obedience
to their commands was devoted to destruction, and the rich
man, who was not of their clan, was obliged silently to acquiesce in
deeds of which he did not approve. The Feitozas are descendants
of Europeans, but many of the branches are of mixed blood, and perhaps
few are free from some tinge of the original inhabitants of Brazil.
The chief of the family was a colonel of militia, and could at a
short notice call together about one hundred men, which is equal to
ten or twenty times the number in a well-peopled country. Deserters
were well received by him, and murderers who had committed
this crime in the revenge of injuries; the thief was not accepted, and
much less the man who for the sake of pillage had taken the life of
another.</p>

<p>Joam Carlos had received from Lisbon secret instructions to secure
the person of this chief of the Feitozas. His first step was to inform
the colonel, that he intended on a certain day to visit him at his village,
for the purpose of reviewing his regiment. The village is not
many leagues from the coast, but is distant considerably from Searà.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
Feitoza answered, that he should be ready to receive His Excellency
on the appointed day. The time came and Joam Carlos set out, accompanied
by ten or twelve persons; the colonel greeted him most
courteously, and had assembled all his men to make the greatest possible
shew. After the review, the colonel dismissed them, fatigued
with the day’s exercise, for many of them had travelled several
leagues. He retired with the governor to his house, accompanied
by a few of his near relations. At the time all the party was preparing
to settle for the night, Joam Carlos, having arranged every
thing with his own people, rose and presented a pistol to the breast
of the chief, his followers doing the same to the colonel’s relations
and servants, who were unable to make any resistance, as they were
unprepared, and not so numerous as the governor’s men. Joam
Carlos told Feitoza, that if he spoke or made the least noise he should
immediately fire, though he well knew that his own destruction would
be certain. He conducted him to the back door, and ordered him
and all the persons present to mount the horses which had been prepared
for them. They made for the sea-shore, and arrived there
very early in the morning; <i>jangadas</i> were in waiting to take them on
board a smack, which was lying off and on near to the coast. The
alarm was given soon after their departure from Feitoza’s village, and
as the governor reached the smack, he saw the colonel’s adherents
upon the beach, embarking in <i>jangadas</i> to try to overtake them, but
it was too late; the smack left the land, and the next day made for
the shore, landed the governor, and then proceeded on her voyage.
Feitoza was supposed to be in the prison of the Limoeiro at Lisbon
when the French entered Portugal, and either died about that time
or was released by them<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>. His followers still look forwards to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
return. The loss of their chiefs broke the power and union of the
clan, and they have had disputes among themselves. Brazil is likewise
undergoing a change of manners, and emerging rapidly from
semi-barbarism.</p>

<p>A young man of Searà had been, a short time before my arrival, to
the distance of thirty leagues into the interior, accompanied by two
constables, to serve a writ upon a man of some property for a debt;
they rode good horses, that they might perform their errand before he
could have any knowledge that they were going, and might attempt,
in consequence, any thing against their lives. It is a dangerous
service to go into the interior to recover debts. The Portugueze
law does not allow of arrest for debt, but by serving a writ any property
which was sent down to the town to be shipped might be seized.</p>

<p>I was received at Searà most hospitably; the name of Englishman
was a recommendation. In the morning I generally remained at
home, and in the afternoon rode out with three or four of the young
men of the place, who were much superior to any I had expected
to find here, and in the evening a large party usually assembled at
the house of Senhor Marcos; his company and that of his wife and
daughter would have been very pleasant anywhere, but was particularly
so in these uncivilized regions. Parties were likewise occasionally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
given at the palace, and at both these places, after tea and coffee,
cards and conversation made the evenings pass very quickly. The
palace was the only dwelling in the town which had boarded floors; it
appeared at first rather strange to be received by one of the principal
officers of the province, in a room with a brick floor and plain white
washed walls, as occurred at the house of Senhor Marcos.</p>

<p>This gentleman had delivered to me a crimson coloured satin bag,
containing government papers, and directed to the Prince Regent of
Portugal and Brazil, and he gave me directions to put it into the
hands of the post-master at Pernambuco. I obtained, from being
the bearer, the power of requiring horses from the several commandants
upon the road. To him it was convenient, as with me its
chance of safety was greater than if it had been forwarded by a
single man on foot, which is the usual mode of conveyance. The
men employed for this purpose are trust-worthy, but must of course
sometimes meet with accidents.</p>

<p>I had in my journey from Goiana to Searà seen Pernambuco, and
the adjoining provinces to the northward, in almost their worst state&mdash;that
of one whole season without rain; but extreme wretchedness
is produced by two successive years of drought; in such a case, on the
second year, the peasants die by the road side; entire families are swept
away, entire districts are depopulated. The country was in this dreadful
state in 1791, 2, 3, for these three years passed without any considerable
fall of rain. In 1810, food was still to be purchased, though
at exorbitant prices, and in the following year the rains came down in
abundance, and removed the dread of famine. I had, I say, seen the
provinces through which I passed upon the brink of extreme want,
owing to the failure of the rains; I had myself experienced inconvenience
from this cause, and in one instance considerable distress
from it; now in returning, the whole country was changed, the rains
had commenced, and I was made to feel that great discomfort is
caused by each extreme; but the sensations which the apprehension
of a want of water produces are much more painful than the disagreeable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
effects of an immoderate quantity of it&mdash;heavy rains and
flooded lands.</p>

<p>I was obliged to stay at Searà longer than I had at first intended,
owing to an accident which I met with in bathing; this confined me
to my bed for some days. As soon as I was allowed to move I
made preparations for my return; I purchased four horses, one to
carry my trunk and a small barrel of biscuit, a second for <i>farinha</i>,
a third for maize, and the fourth for myself. Senhor Lourenço sent
for three trusty Indians from one of the villages for the purpose of
accompanying me, and on the 8th January, 1811, I commenced my
return to Pernambuco.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<p class="pch">RETURN.&mdash;FROM SEARA TO NATAL.&mdash;SERTANEJOS.&mdash;CATTLE.&mdash;VEGETABLE
WAX.&mdash;FROM NATAL TO RECIFE.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">I LEFT Searà at day-break with three Indians, and three loaded
horses, and one of the young men with whom I had formed an
acquaintance accompanied me to a short distance from the town. I
deviated on my return to Aracati, in some measure, from the road by
which I had travelled to Searà. The first day passed without any
circumstance worthy of being mentioned, and I was chiefly occupied
in finding out what sort of beings my Indians were, for I had had very
little conversation with them before we set off. In the afternoon of
the second day, having asked one of the Indians if the road was intricate
to our next resting-place, and being answered, that there was
no turning by which I could lose the right path, I left the loaded
horses and rode on, being tired of following them at a foot’s pace;&mdash;this
I had often done on other occasions. About five o’clock I put
up at a cottage in which were two boys, whose appearance was very
wretched, but they seemed glad to say that they would let me have a
night’s lodging. On enquiry, they told me that their parents were
gone to some distance to make paste from the stem of the Carnàûba,
for that their usual food, the flour of the mandioc, was no longer to
be had at any price in that neighbourhood. I was shown some of
this paste, which was of a dark brown colour<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>, and of the consistence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
of dough that has not been sufficiently kneaded; it was bitter and
nauseous to the taste. On this substance these miserable people
were under the necessity of subsisting, adding to it occasionally dried
fish or meat. My party arrived about an hour after me, and late in
the evening, the younger boy began to beg; inconsiderately I gave
him money, but shortly he returned, saying his elder brother
desired him to tell me, that it would be of no use to them, as nothing
could be purchased with it. Then I understood their meaning
in begging at this moment,&mdash;my men were going to supper,&mdash;the
children were of course desired to sit down with them. Here Feliciano,
one of the Indians, sewed two hides loosely round the two bags
of <i>farinha</i>, saying, that if we proceeded without disguising what they
contained, we should at some hamlet upon the road be obliged to
satisfy the people, who would probably beg part of it from us. He
had not known, before he enquired from these children, that this part
of the country was in such a dreadful state of want. The inhabitants
had eaten up their own scanty crop, and some of them had
even been tempted by the exorbitant price, to carry their stock to
Searà for sale. They had not heard of the supply which had arrived
at that place from the southward. We reached Aracati on the
fifth day.</p>

<p>I remained two days at Aracati, that the horses might be brought
from the island upon which they had been put out to grass. I experienced
fully now what the guide had before told me respecting
the horses. They had all lost flesh, and were apparently less fit for
work than when I first arrived at Aracati, though doubtless the relief
from daily work for so long a period must have rendered them better
able to renew it again now. The Spanish discoverers in South
America, who understood the business into which they had entered,
strongly inculcated to their people the necessity of the steady and
regular continuance of their journies, unless a pause could have been
made for some length of time<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>. I bought a large dog at Aracati,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
which had been trained to keep watch over the baggage of travellers.</p>

<p>A man presented himself here, requesting to be allowed to go
with me to Pernambuco. He described himself as a Portugueze
sailor, a European by birth, and as having belonged to the Portugueze
sloop of war, called the Andorinha, which was wrecked upon the
coast between Parà and Maranham. He had travelled from the spot
at which he had landed to this place without any assistance from
government. No provision had been made by any of the men in
power for the subsistence of the persons who escaped. I consented
to his joining me; he behaved well, and I never afterwards had any
cause to doubt the truth of his story.</p>

<p>I had now a great increase in my number of men and horses, but
was advised to take the men all forwards with me, as the rains
might commence and the rivers fill, in which case the more people
I had to assist in crossing them, with less danger would it be accomplished.
The additional number of horses enabled me to divide
the weight into smaller loads, and to have two or three beasts unencumbered,
for the purpose of relieving the others if necessary. The
party now consisted of nine persons and eleven horses.</p>

<p>Senhor Barrozo’s kindness was still continued towards me, and I
hope I shall never cease to feel grateful for it.</p>

<p>I was advised to get on to the sea-shore as soon as possible on leaving
Aracati, this being the better road; consequently I slept the
first night, distant three leagues from that place, at Alagoa do Mato&mdash;a
small lake which was now nearly dried up. The following morning
we travelled over the sands, passed a small village near to the
shore called Retiro, and slept at Cajuaes, a place we were acquainted
with; and from hence to St. Luzia we followed the same route as in
going to Searà. From Cajuaes we passed through Areias, famous for the
ghost story, and rested at Tibou, proceeding in the afternoon with the
intention of sleeping at the unfinished house on the road to Ilha;
but the night was closing in upon us when we were still two leagues
short of it, and for this reason it was thought adviseable to stop and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
pass the night among the brushwood. We had had several showers
of rain, occasionally for some days past, and although they were
slight, the grass had begun to spring up in some places. The rapidity
of vegetation in Brazil is truly astonishing. Rain in the evening
upon good soil will by sunrise have given a greenish tinge to the
earth, which is increased, if the rain continues, on the second day to
sprouts of grass of an inch in length, and these on the third day are
sufficiently long to be picked up by the half starved cattle.</p>

<p>The brushwood among which we had determined to pass the night
was low and not close, so that only two shrubs were found to be near
enough to each other and of sufficient strength to support a hammock;
between these mine was hung, whilst the people took up their
quarters upon the packages as to them seemed best. Between one
and two o’clock in the morning the rain commenced, at first, with
some moderation; the guide fastened two cords from shrub to shrub
above my hammock, and laid some hides upon them as a covering for
me, but soon the rain increased, and the whole party crowded under
the hides. I got up, and all of us stood together in some degree
sheltered, until the hides fell down owing to their being quite soaked.
Our fires were of course completely extinguished. I reminded my
people of the necessity of keeping the locks of our fire-arms dry;
indeed those persons of the party who knew the Sertam must be
even more aware than myself of the numbers of Jaguars which are to
be met with upon these <i>travessias</i>. I had not spoken many minutes
before Feliciano said that he heard the growl of one of these animals&mdash;he
was right, for a lot of mares galloped across the path not far
from us, and shortly after the growl was distinctly heard; either the
same or many of these beasts were near to us during the remainder
of the night, as we heard the growl in several directions. We stood
with our backs to each other and by no means free from the chance
of being attacked, though the Indians from time to time set up a sort
of song or howl, (such as is practised by the Sertanejos when guiding
large droves of half tamed cattle) with the intent of frightening the
Jaguars. Towards day-break the deluge somewhat abated, but still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
the rain was hard and it did not cease. In the morning there was
much difficulty in finding the horses, as the Jaguars had frightened
and scattered them; indeed we much doubted that they would all be
alive, but I suppose the wild cattle were preferred as being in better
condition. The loads were arranged and we proceeded to Ilha, distant
six leagues, arriving there about two o’clock in the afternoon,
after having sustained twelve hours of continued rain. The owner
of the estate of Ilha sent a message to say that he wished me to remove
from the out-house, in which I had settled myself for the remainder
of the day and ensuing night, to his residence; I accepted
his offer. It was a low, mud cottage covered with tiles, which had
been made from the clay that is to be found upon the skirts of the salt
marsh near to which his house stood. He gave us plenty of milk
and dried meat; there was a scarcity of <i>farinha</i>, but a plentiful year
was expected. Immediately on my entrance into his house he offered
me his hammock, in which he had been sitting, but mine was soon
slung and we sat, talked, and smoked for a considerable time. The
mosquitos were very troublesome, indeed from this day we were
scarcely ever without them at night, and they annoyed us more or
less, according to the state of the wind and the quantity of rain
which had fallen during the day. The inconvenience occasioned by
these insects is inconceivable, until it has been experienced.</p>

<p>The next day we advanced to the village of St. Luzia, and rested
at noon there in an unfinished cottage. Soon after we had unloaded
our horses and I had lain myself down in my hammock intending to
sleep, the guide told me that a number of people appeared to be
assembling near to us, and that I ought to recollect the quarrel which
we had had here in going. I got up and asked for my trunk, opened
it with as little apparent design as possible, turned over several things
in it, and taking out the Red Bag, placed it upon a large log of timber
near to me, and then I continued to search in the trunk, as if for
something I could not immediately find. When I looked up again,
in a few minutes, all the persons who had assembled were gone&mdash;either
the important consequences attending this bag were known,&mdash;that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
of having the power of making a requisition of horses, or some
other idea of my situation in life was given by the sight of this
magical bag. The river near St. Luzia had not yet filled. We proceeded
in the afternoon and reached the banks of the river Panema,
a narrow but now a rapid stream. One of the men went in to try if
it was fordable, but before he was half way across he found that it
would be impossible to pass, as the rapidity and depth would effectually
prevent any attempt to carry the packages over upon the heads
of the Indians. I desired the people to remain where they were,
whilst I turned back with the Goiana guide to look for some habitation,
because, owing to the commencement of the rains, sleeping in
the open air would have been highly imprudent.</p>

<p>We made for a house, which was situated among the Carnàûba
trees, at some distance from the road, and as the owner of it said that
he could accommodate us, and that there was abundance of grass for
our horses, the guide returned to bring the party to this place, which
was called St. Anna. In the course of the night I had an attack of
ague, which would have delayed me at St. Anna even if the height
of the waters had not prevented me from proceeding. However I
became more unwell, and perhaps I imagined myself to be worse
than I really was, but I began to wish to arrive at Açù, as, by so doing,
I should be advancing upon my journey, and at the same time
I should obtain the advantage of being near to some priest, to
whom I could impart any message which I might have to send to my
friends. Although I was not in immediate danger, I was aware of
the sudden changes to which aguish disorders are liable. As soon as
the waters began to subside I determined to remove, but as I could
not mount on horseback, it would be necessary that I should be carried
in a hammock; however the difficulty consisted in procuring a
sufficient number of men. By waiting another day six persons were
obtained from the cottages in the vicinity, some of which were distant
more than a league. On the fifth day from that of my arrival
here, we set off, crossed the river, which was barely fordable, and entered
upon the flooded lands. The waters covered the whole face of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
the country, though they were now subsiding a little. The depth
was in parts up to the waist, but was in general less than knee-deep.
The men knew the way from practice, but even the guide whom I had
hired at Açu could not have found it without the assistance of those who
carried me. At noon the hammock with me in it was hung between
two trees, resting the two ends of the pole by which the men carried
it upon two forked branches; and hides were placed over
this pole to shade me from the sun, as the trees had not recovered
from the drought and were yet without leaves. The men slung their
hammocks also, the packages were supported upon the branches of
trees, and the horses stood in the water and eat their maize out of
bags which were tied round their noses. The water was shallow
here, as this spot was rather higher than the lands around; and in
one place the ground was beginning to make its appearance. At
dusk we reached Chafaris, a <i>fazenda</i>, situated upon dry land, and here
we put up under an unfinished house. The horse upon which my
trunk and case of bottles had travelled, had fallen down, and to add
to my discomfort, my cloaths were completely wetted, and even the
red bag did not entirely escape.</p>

<p>I passed a wretched night, from the ague and from over fatigue.
The following morning I had some conversation with the owner of
the place, and purchased two of his horses. At noon I sent off the
<i>comboio</i>, under the care of Feliciano, who was desired to reach Piatô
the following night. I remained with the Goiana guide and Julio,
who had been promoted to John’s place of groom. With considerable
difficulty the packages were carried across the river, which
runs just below this estate; the stream was at present rapid, and the
stony bed in which it runs increased the difficulty. When I passed
on the morning following, the depth and rapidity of the current were
considerably diminished, for no rain had fallen during the night. I
had mounted the two persons who accompanied me upon the two
horses which had been purchased the day before, and I rode a led horse
which was quite fresh; resolving to arrive at Piatô, distant ten
leagues, in one day; this I accomplished, resting only a short time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
at noon. I was very unfit for so much exertion, but the necessity of
the case did not allow me any alternative, and I was determined to
ride until absolute exhaustion forced me to give way.</p>

<p>We overtook my people, and all of us rested at the same place. Feliciano
shot an antelope, upon which we dined. It was seldom if ever
absolutely necessary to depend upon our guns for subsistence, though
the provision thus obtained was by no means unacceptable, as it
varied our diet. We could generally either purchase a considerable
supply of dried meat, or as occasionally occurred, it was afforded us
gratuitously. Sheep were sometimes to be bought, and at others,
fowls might be obtained on enquiring at the cottages; but although
numbers of the latter were to be seen about the huts, and a high
price offered, still the owners frequently refused to part with them.
The women, naturally enough, had the management of this department
of household arrangement, and after much bargaining, the housewife
would often at last declare, that all of them were such favourites,
that she and her children could not resolve to have any of them killed.
This behaviour became so frequent, that at last when either the guide
or myself rode up to a cottage to purchase a fowl, it was quite decisive
with us, if the husband called to his wife, saying that she would settle
the matter. Unless we had time to spare for talking, we generally
went our way.</p>

<p>My friend the commandant was still residing at Piatô; I felt as if
I was returning home; my spirits were low, and any trifle relieved
them. This night I was still very unwell, my thirst was great, and
nothing satisfied and allayed it so much as water-melons, of which
there was here a superabundance. I ate several of them. The
guide said I should kill myself; but I thought otherwise, for I liked
the fruit. In the morning I awoke quite a changed person, and the
ague returned no more. The guide often said afterwards that he
never had known until the present occasion, that water-melons might
be taken as a cure for the ague. He was quite certain that they had
performed the cure, and that they would have the same effect upon
all persons in the same disease. Such are the changes to which this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
strange complaint is subject; often thus suddenly leaving the patient,
but as frequently or more so, ending in fever and delirium; however
it seldom proves fatal.</p>

<p>On the morrow we left Piatô, with the addition to our party of a
small tame sheep, and a tame <i>tatu-bola</i>, or armadillo, both having been
given to me by the commandant. The former kept pace with the
horses for many days, and it never gave us any trouble, until the long
continuance of the journey wearied it out, and then I was obliged to
make room for it in one of the panniers; in this manner it travelled
for a day or two at a time. The armadillo was conveyed in a small
bag, and only on one occasion gave us any trouble; when we released
it at our resting-places, it usually remained among the packages,
either feeding or rolled up. It was with some difficulty that Mimoza
was prevented from annoying it; but latterly she and the armadillo
were very good friends. At Açu I changed one of my horses for
another that was in better condition, and gave about the value of a
guinea to boot.</p>

<p>Our friends, the saddler and the owner of the house which we had
inhabited in going, received us very cordially, and offered to assist us in
crossing the river, which was full; but they advised me to wait for a
decrease of the depth and rapidity of the stream; however I was
anxious to advance, and my people made no objection. Here I discharged
the young man whom I had taken from hence as a guide to
Aracati. We crossed the smaller branch of the river, with the water
reaching to the flaps of the saddles. When we arrived at the second
and principal branch, it was discovered that a <i>jangada</i> would be necessary
to convey the baggage across. Several of the inhabitants of
the place had followed us, judging that this would be the case, and they
were willing to be of service to us in expectation of being compensated
for their trouble. A few logs of timber were soon procured; some of
them had been brought down by the stream, and were now upon the
banks, and others were conveyed from the town; the cords with which
the packages were fastened to the pack-saddles were made use of to tie
the logs together, for the purpose of forming the raft. The father of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
the young man who had been with me to Aracati accompanied us to
the river side to assist, and had brought Mimoza with him. I requested
him to secure her, otherwise I thought she would follow me;
he did so, and sent her back to the town by a boy. When the raft
was prepared, the saddles and all the packages were placed upon it,
and I sat down among them. Four men laid hold of each side of
the raft, and shoved off from the shore, and when they lost their
footing, each man kept hold of the raft with one hand, swimming
with the other; but notwithstanding their exertions, the stream carried
us down about fifty yards before we reached the other side,
which however was gained in safety. The Indians were already
there with the horses. The river of Açu is from two to three
hundred yards in breadth; it was now deep and dangerous, and from
the violence of the current, a guide is requisite, that advantage may
be taken of the shallowest parts. The Sertanejos have a curious
contrivance for crossing rivers, which is formed of three pieces of
wood, and upon this they paddle themselves to the opposite side. I
heard it often spoken of by the name of <i>cavalete</i>; but as I
did not see any of them, I cannot pretend to give an exact description<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>.</p>

<p>The men soon left us to arrange the loads, which we were doing
with all possible expedition, when on turning round, I saw Mimoza
running up to me, half crouched and half afraid. I had often wished
to purchase this animal, but nothing would induce her master to part
with her; he said that he had had her from a whelp, and added, that
if he put the pot upon the fire, and then went out with her, he was
sure to return by the time it boiled, bringing something with which
to fill it. He did not mean that this was literally the case; but thus
quaintly he wished to impress the idea of her great expertness in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
hunting. She followed us, as she found that she was well received.
We advanced, and halted at St. Ursula, a <i>fazenda</i>, distant from Açu
one league and a half, and here we slept. The roads lay through
woods, which were thick and close. From hence to the Seara-meirim,
the country was new to me, as I deviated from the road by which I
had arrived at Açu, on my way northwards. I now took the shortest
road to Natal, but had frequently to cross this winding river.</p>

<p>Whilst I was at dinner, Mimoza was near to me, watching for her
share, when suddenly she crept under the bench upon which I sat;
I soon saw what had caused this movement, for the old man, the
father of her owner, was coming towards us; he said that he came
for his son’s dog. I persuaded him to sell her, and when he was
going his way, Mimoza ran out from under the bench and fawned
upon him. I told him to go on, and invite her to follow him; but
upon this she immediately returned growling to her old station under
the bench. She had been better treated and better fed with me
than when she was with her master. I always fed her myself, and
had several times prevented him from beating her.</p>

<p>The next day we passed through the <i>fazendas</i> of Passagem and
Barra; the road was over loose stony ground and we crossed one dry
marsh. In the afternoon we travelled from S. Bento to Anjicos,
which obliged us to pass over some higher ground, which was very
stony and painful to our horses. We crossed a small shallow stream
several times.</p>

<p>Our next day’s march carried us across more stony ground. The
persons to whom we spoke, said that there had been no rain, and
indeed this was evident. There was no grass, and the country was
yet parched and dreary. The horses had no water at noon, for the
well was small, and the spring which supplied it was insufficient for
so great a number of beasts. I was thirsty in the afternoon, and
therefore left the <i>comboio</i> to follow at its usual pace, and rode on
accompanied by Julio; the two dogs likewise would come with us.
We entered upon a plain, and now for the second time I saw an
<i>ema</i>, a species of ostrich. Notwithstanding my attempts to prevent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
them, the dogs set off after it, and much against my inclination
I was obliged to wait until their return. The bird ran from
them with great velocity, flapping its wings, but never leaving
the ground. The <i>emas</i> outstrip the fleetest horses. The colour
of the one which we saw was a dark grey; its height, including
the neck, which was very long, was about that of a man on
horseback, and it had that appearance at first sight, when at some
distance. The Sertanejos say, that when pursued the <i>ema</i> spurs itself
to run the faster; that the spurs or pointed bones are placed in
the inside of the wings, and that as these are flapped, the bones
strike the sides and wound them. I have heard many people say,
that when an <i>ema</i> is caught after a hard chase, the sides are found to
be bloody. It is possible that this effect may be produced by some
cause similar to that by which a pig cuts its own throat in swimming.
The eggs of the <i>ema</i> are large, and although the food which
they afford is coarse, it is not unpalatable. The feathers are much
esteemed. When the dogs returned we continued our journey; the
road led us between high rocks, and after proceeding along it for some
time, the dogs suddenly struck from the path, and went up the side
of a flat rock, which sloped down towards the road, but was sufficiently
low to allow of a horse ascending it. Our horses stopped and
snuffed up the air. Julio cried out at the same time “water, water,” and
spurred his horse to follow the dogs, and I did the same. Julio was quite
correct in what he had supposed, from the direction which the dogs
immediately took, and from the stopping of the horses. There was a
long and narrow but deep cleft in the rock, which was nearly full of
water, clear and cold. The sides of the cleft slanted inwards, and
the water was below the surface, so that the dogs were running
round and howling, without being able to reach it; the horses too,
as soon as we dismounted, and they saw the water, began to paw, and
attempted to press forwards to drink. We had brought no vessel
with which to take up any of it, and were under the necessity of using
our hats to satisfy the horses and dogs. The rest of the party came
up after some time; Feliciano was acquainted with the spot, but if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
the dogs and horses had not pointed it out to Julio, he and I should
have missed it. We were delayed considerably in giving water
enough to all the horses, as we had no large vessel in which to take
it up. I heard from Feliciano, and subsequently from other persons,
that these clefts in the rocks are common; but that they are known
to few, and those principally of his rank and occupation in life, and
that this knowledge enabled them to find plenty of water when
others were in great distress. He said, “we never refuse to give
information, but we say as little about it as possible.” I travelled
until ten o’clock at night, wishing to reach some <i>fazenda</i>, and not to
remain in the open air, as there were several heavy clouds flying
about, from the look of which we well knew that if the wind abated,
rain would come on. We reached a <i>fazenda</i>, and applied for a
night’s lodging, which was granted; but upon a survey of the interior
of the house, I preferred the open air with all its disadvantages.
The place was full of persons who had assembled from the neighbouring
estates, in expectation of rain, as they had come to assist in
collecting cattle. The fellows were eating dried meat, and had by
some means obtained a quantity of rum. I took up my station at a
distance from the house, and we scarcely laid down during the night,
from the fear of rain, and in some measure that we might be prepared
to prevent any of our horses being stolen, as a piece of sport,
by the people in the house.</p>

<p>The next day we crossed over a plain which was partly without
trees and in part covered with brushwood; in going over this last
portion I had pushed on with Julio, leaving the <i>comboio</i> to follow us.
We had nearly lost our way at the division of several paths; even
Julio’s knowledge was insufficient, and had we not met some travellers
and enquired of them, I know not how far from the baggage we
might have been at night.</p>

<p>On the following morning we advanced again, took water in skins
near to some cottages, and at noon stationed ourselves in the bed of a
rivulet, where there was good grass, but no water. As the bed was
lower than the neighbouring land the very first shower had made the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
grass spring up, though there had not been rain sufficient to excite
vegetation upon its banks. Here the armadillo strayed into some
brushwood; Feliciano followed it by the marks of its footsteps over
the grass and dry leaves, and brought it back. I am quite confident
that he did not see which way it went, and to a person unused to
tracing footsteps there appeared to be none. If it had passed over
sand, there would not have been any thing extraordinary in discovering
the way which the animal had taken, but upon grass and dry
leaves so small an animal could make but a most trifling impression.
I mentioned at this place accidentally that the skins had spoiled the
water, for it tasted of the grease with which they had been rubbed.
Feliciano heard me, and took up a small skin that lay empty, which
was old and therefore not greasy, and said, “I’ll try to find some for
you that is better;” and away he went. In about an hour he returned
with the skin full of excellent water. He had recollected a cleft in
a rock at some distance, and had gone to see if any yet remained
in it.</p>

<p>We slept at a <i>fazenda</i>, and the next day proceeded in the expectation
of reaching the Searà-meirim, which we did. This track of
country had not recovered from the drought, but the trees were
beginning to be cloathed, and the grass under them was in most
parts of sufficient length to afford subsistence to our horses. Water
was still scarce and bad, but the rain had made it less brackish and
more plentiful. We passed over the <i>travessia</i> with all possible haste,
as the floods were expected shortly, and sometimes the water comes
down, as I have before stated, with great rapidity. There is some
danger in being caught by the water upon any of the peninsulas
or islands which are formed by its bends, for to be under the necessity
of crossing over a stream which runs with much violence, perhaps
ten times or more successively, would be too much for almost
any horse to bear, and particularly for those which were already
fatigued by a long journey. We left the Searà-meirim in four days,
passed Pai Paulo, and early on the fifth day arrived again at the dry
lake. The people of this place were upon the point of decamping,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
as the rains were expected or rather had already commenced. We
now met several parties of travellers, who had taken advantage of
the first rains to pass over this track of country, and who were
hastening before the floods came down the river.</p>

<p>January is not properly speaking the rainy season. The rains at
the commencement of the year are called the <i>primeiras aguas</i> or the
first waters, and continue for about a fortnight or three weeks, after
which the weather generally becomes again settled until May or
June, and from this time until the end of August the rains are
usually pretty constant. From August or September until the opening
of the year there is not usually any rain. The dry weather can
be depended upon with more certainty from September until January,
than from February until May; likewise the wet weather can be
looked for with more certainty from June until August than in
January. There are very few days during the whole course of the
year of incessant rain. What I have said regarding the seasons must
however be taken with some latitude, as in all climates they are subject
to variation.</p>

<p>The horse I left at the dry lake was faithfully delivered to me, and
I continued my journey on the following day to Natal. The governor
received me with the same cordiality as before.</p>

<p>I had now left the Sertam, and though it treated me rather roughly,
still I have always wished I could have seen more of it. There is a
certain pleasure which I cannot describe in crossing new countries,
and that portion of territory over which I had travelled was new to an
Englishman. From the sensations which I experienced I can well
imagine what those are, which travellers in unexplored countries
must feel at every step&mdash;at every novelty which comes under their
view. There is yet much ground upon the continent of South
America to be traversed, and I most heartily wish that it had been
my fate to be the civilized individual first doomed to cross from
Pernambuco to Lima.</p>

<p>I have perhaps hardly said sufficient to give a correct idea of the
inhabitants of the <i>fazendas</i> or cattle estates. Unlike the Peons of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
country in the vicinity of the river Plata, the Sertanejo has about him
his wife and family, and lives in comparative comfort. The cottages
are small and are built of mud, but afford quite sufficient shelter in so
fine a climate; they are covered with tiles where these are to be had,
or, as is more general, with the leaves of the Carnàûba. Hammocks
usually supply the place of beds and are by far more comfortable,
and these are likewise frequently used as chairs. Most of the better
sort of cottages contain a table, but the usual practice is for the family
to squat down upon a mat in a circle, with the bowls, dishes, or gourds
in the centre, thus to eat their meals upon the floor. Knives and
forks are not much known, and are not at all made use of by the
lower orders. It is the custom in every house, from the highest to the
lowest, as in former times, and indeed the same practice prevails in
all the parts of the country which I visited, for a silver basin, or
one of earthenware, or a <i>cuia</i>, and a fringed cambric towel, or
one that is made of the coarse cotton cloth of the country, to be
handed round, that all those who are going to sit down to eat may
wash their hands; and the same ceremony, or rather necessary piece of
cleanliness, takes place again after the meal is finished. Of the gourds
great use is made in domestic arrangements; they are cut in two and
the pulp is scooped out, then the rind is dried and these rude vessels
serve almost every purpose of earthenware&mdash;water is carried in them,
&amp;c. and they are likewise used as measures. They vary from six inches
in circumference to about three feet, and are usually rather of an oval
shape. The gourd when whole is called <i>cabaça</i>, and the half of the
rind is called <i>cuia</i>. It is a creeping plant, and grows spontaneously
in many parts, but in others the people plant it among the mandioc.</p>

<p>The conversation of the Sertanejos usually turns upon the state of
their cattle or of women, and occasionally, accounts of adventures which
took place at Recife or at some other town. The merits or demerits
of the priests with whom they may happen to be acquainted are likewise
discussed, and their irregular practices are made a subject of
ridicule. The dress of the men has already been described, but
when they are at home a shirt and drawers alone remain. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
women have a more slovenly look, as their only dress is a shift and
petticoat, no stockings, and oftentimes no shoes; but when they leave
home, which is very seldom, an addition is made of a large piece of
coarse white cloth, either of their own or of European manufacture,
and this is thrown over the head and shoulders; a pair of shoes is
likewise then put on. They are good horsewomen, and the high Portugueze
saddle serves the purpose of a side-saddle very completely.
I never saw any Brazilian woman riding, as is the case occasionally
in Portugal, in the manner that men do. Their employment consists
in household arrangements entirely, for the men even milk the
cows and goats: the women spin and work with the needle. No
females of free birth are ever seen employed in any kind of labour in
the open air, excepting in that of occasionally fetching wood or water,
if the men are not at home. The children generally run about naked
until a certain age, but this is often seen even in Recife; to the age
of six or seven years, boys are allowed to run about without any
cloathing. Formerly, I mean before the commencement of a direct
trade with England, both sexes dressed in the coarse cotton cloth
which is made in the country; the petticoats of this cloth were sometimes
tinged with a red dye, which was obtained from the bark of the
<i>coipuna</i> tree, a native of their woods; and even now this dye is used
for tinging fishing-nets, as it is said that those which have undergone
this process last the longer.</p>

<p>In those times, a dress of the common printed cotton of English or
of Portugueze manufacture cost from eight to twelve <i>mil reis</i>, from
two to three guineas, owing to the monopoly of the trade, by which
the merchants of Recife put what price they pleased upon their commodities;
other things were in proportion. Owing to the enormous
prices, European articles of dress could of course only be possessed
by the rich people. However, since the opening of the ports to
foreign trade, English goods are finding their way all over the country,
and the hawkers are now a numerous body of men. The women
seldom appear, and when they are seen do not take any part in the conversation,
unless it be some one good wife who rules the roast; if they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
are present at all when the men are talking, they stand or squat down
upon the ground, in the door-way leading to the interior of the house,
and merely listen. The morals of the men are by no means strict,
and when this is the case, it must give an unfavourable bias, in some
degree, to those of the women; but the Sertanejo is very jealous, and
more murders are committed, and more quarrels entered into on
this score, by tenfold, than on any other. These people are revengeful;
an offence is seldom pardoned, and in default of law, of which
there is scarcely any, each man takes it into his own hands. This
is without any sort of doubt a dreadful state of society, and I do not
by any means pretend to speak in its justification; but if the causes
of most of the murders committed and beatings given are enquired
into, I have usually found that the receiver had only obtained what
he deserved. Robbery in the Sertam is scarcely known; the land is
in favourable years too plentiful to afford temptation, and in seasons
of distress for food, every man is for the most part equally in want.
Subsistence is to be obtained in an easier manner than by stealing
in so abundant a country, and where both parties are equally brave
and resolute; but besides these reasons, I think the Sertanejos are a
good race of people. They are tractable and might easily be instructed,
excepting in religious matters; in these they are fast rivetted; and such
was their idea of an Englishman and a heretic, that it was on some
occasions difficult to make them believe that I, who had the figure of
a human being, could possibly belong to that non-descript race. They
are extremely ignorant, few of them possessing even the commonest
rudiments of knowledge. Their religion is confined to the observance
of certain forms and ceremonies, and to the frequent repetition of a few
prayers, faith in charms, relics, and other things of the same order.
The Sertanejos are courageous, generous, sincere, and hospitable:
if a favour is begged, they know not how to deny it; but if you trade
with them either for cattle, or aught else, the character changes, and
then they wish to outwit you, conceiving success to be a piece of
cleverness of which they may boast.</p>

<p>The following anecdote is characteristic. A Sertanejo came down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
from the interior with a large drove of cattle, which had been entrusted
to him to sell; he obtained a purchaser, who was to pay him
at the close of two or three months. The Sertanejo waited to receive
the money, as his home was too far distant to return for this
purpose. Before the expiration of the term, the purchaser of the
cattle found some means of having him imprisoned; he went to him
when he was in confinement, and pretending to be extremely sorry for
his misfortune, hinted, that if he would allow him to appropriate part of
the debt to the purpose, he would try to obtain his release; to this
the Sertanejo agreed, and consequently soon obtained his freedom.
He heard soon afterwards how the whole of the business had been
managed by the purchaser of the cattle, to avoid paying for what he
had bought, and he could not obtain any part of the money. Having
advised his employers in the Sertam of these circumstances, he received
for answer, that the loss of the money was of little consequence,
but that he must either assassinate the man who had injured
him, or not return home; because he should himself suffer if the
insult remained unrevenged. The Sertanejo immediately made preparations
for returning; he had always feigned great thankfulness
towards his debtor for obtaining his release, and a total ignorance of
his unjustifiable conduct. On the day of his departure, he rode to
the house of the man whom he had determined to destroy, and dismounted,
whilst one of his two companions held his horse; he saw
the owner of the house, and as he gave him the usual parting embrace,
ran his long knife into his side; he then quickly leapt on to his
horse, and the three persons rode off. None dared to molest them,
for they were well armed, and although this occurred in a large town,
they soon joined a considerable number of their countrymen who
waited for them in the outskirts, and proceeded to their own country,
without any attempt being made to apprehend them. These circumstances
took place several years ago; but the relatives of the
man who was killed still bear in mind his death, and a determination
of revenging it upon him who committed it, if he was again to place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
himself within their reach. Many persons can vouch for the truth of
the story.</p>

<p>The colour of the Sertanejos varies from white, of which there are
necessarily few, to a dark brown; the shades of which are almost
as various as there are persons: two of exactly the same tint are
scarcely to be met with. Children of the same parents rarely if ever
are of the same shade; some difference is almost always perceivable,
and this is, in many instances, so glaring, as to lead at first to doubts
of the authenticity; but it is too general to be aught but what is
right. The offspring of white and black persons leans, in most instances,
more to one colour than to the other, when perhaps a second
child will take a contrary tinge<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>. These remarks do not only
hold good in the Sertam, but are applicable to all the country which
I had opportunities of seeing. The Sertanejo, if colour is set
aside, is certainly handsome; and the women, whilst young, have
well-shaped forms, and many of them good features; indeed I have
seen some of the white persons who would be admired in any
country. Their constant exposure to the sun, and its great power at
a distance from the sea, darkens the complexion more than if the
same persons had resided upon the coast; but this gives them a
decided dark colour, which has the appearance of durability, and is
much preferable to a sallow sickly look, though of a lighter tint.</p>

<p>The persons who reside upon and have the care of the cattle estates,
are called <i>Vaqueiros</i>, which simply means cowherds. They have a
share of the calves and foals that are reared upon the land, but of the
lambs, pigs, goats, &amp;c. no account is given to the owner; and from
the quantity of cattle, numbers are reckoned very loosely; it is therefore
a comfortable and lucrative place, but the duties attending it are
heavy, require considerable courage, and great bodily strength and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
activity. Some of the owners live upon their estates; but the major
part of those through which I passed, were possessed by men of large
property, who resided in the towns upon the coast, or who were at the
same time sugar-planters.</p>

<p>The interior of Pernambuco, Rio Grande, Paraiba, and Seara, contains,
properly speaking, no wild cattle<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>. Twice every year the
herdsmen from several estates assemble for the purpose of collecting
the cattle. The cows are driven from all quarters into the area in
front of the house, and here, surrounded by several horsemen, are
put into spacious pens. This being done, the men dismount, and
now their object is, if any of the cows are inclined to be unruly,
which is often the case, to noose them by the horns so as to secure
them; or another mode is adopted, which is by noosing one of the
hind-legs, and carrying the cord quite round the animal, so as to
throw it down. The calves are then caught, and this is done without
much difficulty; they are marked on the right haunch with a red-hot
iron, which is made of the shape that has been fixed upon by the
owner as his peculiar mark. When the oxen are to be collected
for a market, the service is more dangerous, and frequently the rider
is under the necessity of throwing the animal to the ground with his
long pole, as I have in another place mentioned. On the man’s approach,
the ox runs off into the nearest wood, and the man follows,
as closely as he possibly can, that he may take advantage of the opening
of the branches which is made by the beast, as these shortly close
again, resuming their former situation. At times the ox passes
under a low and thick branch of a large tree, then the man likewise
passes under the branch, and that he may do this, he leans to the right
side so completely, as to enable him to lay hold of the girth of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
saddle with his left hand, and at the same time his left heel catches
the flap of the saddle; thus with the pole in his right hand, almost
trailing upon the ground, he follows without slackening his pace,
and being clear of this obstacle, again resumes his seat. If he can
overtake the ox, he runs his goad into its side, and if this is dexterously
done, he throws it. Then he dismounts, and ties the animal’s
legs together, or places one fore-leg over one of the horns, which
secures it most effectually. Many blows are received by these men,
but it is seldom that deaths are occasioned.</p>

<p>In crossing the Seara-meirim, I mentioned an instance of a cow
having strayed to an immense distance from its native pasture. This
propensity to ramble is common among horned cattle, even without
its proceeding from the scarcity of grass or water. Often at the time
of collecting the cattle, those persons who have been to a considerable
distance to assist others, drive back a number of beasts with their
own mark; the estate to which they belonged being distant twenty
leagues or more. When a traveller is in distress for water, he
cannot do better than to follow the first cattle-path, as these usually
lead to the nearest pool of water, in a direct line. The paths are
easily distinguished, being very narrow, and the wood uniting above,
leaving open below only a shady walk, of the height of the animals
which made it.</p>

<p>Each lot of mares with its master horse is driven into the pens;
this consists of from fifteen to twenty in number. The foals are likewise
marked in the same manner as the calves. It is worthy of
remark, and the circumstance was often repeated to me, that the
horse of the lot drives from it not only the colts but the fillies also,
as soon as they are full grown. The fact was only qualified in two or
three instances, when told to me, by the person who related it adding,
that if the horse did not do so, he was taken from the lot, and broken
for the pack-saddle, being considered of a bad breed. When a horse
is to be tamed for any purpose whatsoever, he is noosed, after being
put into a pen, and is tied to a stake; on the following day, or perhaps
the same afternoon, if he appears at all tractable, a small low<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
saddle is placed upon him, and a man then mounts with a double
halter. The animal runs off with him, which the man, far from
attempting to prevent, rather urges him to do; though in general
the whip and spur are not made use of, unless he is obstinate and
refuses to go forwards. Horses of good breeds are said to be those
most easily tamed. The horse runs until he becomes weary, and is
then brought back quietly by its rider; and perhaps they do not
reach the rider’s home until the following day. The man must not
dismount until he has returned to the spot from whence he started,
as he would probably experience great difficulty when he wished
again to proceed, from the restiveness of the horse. The same operation
is continued as long as the animal is not supposed to be
effectually broken in, and safe to mount. It happens on some occasions,
that by plunging, the horse gets rid of both man and saddle,
and is not again seen for a length of time; however, unless the girths
give way, he has little chance of throwing his rider, for the Sertanejos
are most excellent horsemen.</p>

<p>The horses are small, and some of them are finely shaped, though
little attention is paid to the improvement of the breed. Great
stress is laid upon the colour, in the choice of these animals; some
colours being accounted more demonstrative of strength than others.
Thus a cream-coloured horse, with a tail and mane of the same
colour, is rejected for the pack-saddle, or for any kind of
severe labour; and if horses of this description are sold for these
purposes, the price is lower than that of an animal of an equally promising
appearance in form and size, of any other tinge: they are
much esteemed if well shaped, as saddle-horses, for short distances.
A cream-coloured horse, with a black tail and mane, is reckoned
strong. The horses that have one fore-leg white, and the other of
the colour of the body, are supposed to be liable to stumble. The
usual colours are bay and grey; but chesnut, black, and cream-colour
are less common; those most esteemed for work are dark bays,
with black tails and manes, and greys dotted with small bay spots.
Stallions are broken in both for the saddle and for carrying loads in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
the neighbourhood of the towns; but the Sertanejos, both from
necessity and from their knowledge of their superior ability to perform
hard labour, make use of geldings. It is not always safe to ride
a high-spirited horse in the Sertam, because when he begins to neigh,
instances have occurred of some master horse coming to give him
battle, and as both are equally desirous of fighting, the rider may
perhaps find himself under the necessity of placing himself at a
distance from the combatants. However, if he should chance to
have a good stick in his hand, and can prevent his own horse from
rearing as the wild horse approaches, he may come off in safety.</p>

<p>Sheep are kept upon every estate for their flesh, when that of a
more esteemed kind fails; that is, either when the oxen are in a
meagre state, owing to a long continuance of dry weather; or that
the herdsman is too much occupied at home, or too lazy to go out
and kill one. The mutton is never well-tasted, and though it is true
that in the Sertam no care whatever is taken in rearing or feeding
the sheep, still I do not think that this kind of meat is to be brought
to any great perfection<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>. The lambs are covered with fine
wool, and this continues until they are one year and a half or two
years old; but after this age, it begins to drop, and is replaced by a
species of hair. Although the wool should remain longer in some
instances, it appeared to me that it was coarse and short<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>. A wound<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
upon the body of this animal is more difficult to heal than upon that of
any other, and the flesh of it is of all others the most rapid in its
advances to putrefaction.</p>

<p>The division of property in the Sertam is very undeterminate, and
this may be imagined, when I say, that the common mode of defining
the size of a <i>fazenda</i>, is by computing it at so many leagues; or, as in
some cases, by so many hundreds of calves yearly, without any reference
to the quantity of land. Few persons take the trouble of
making themselves acquainted with the exact extent of their own property,
and perhaps could not discover it if they made the attempt.</p>

<p>The climate is good; indeed the inland flat country is much more
healthy than that immediately bordering the coast. I can hardly
name any disorders that appear to be peculiar to it; but several are
known. Agues are not common, but they exist. Dropsy also they
are acquainted with. Ulcers in the legs are common, but less so than
upon the coast. Ruptures frequently occur. The small-pox<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> makes
dreadful ravages, and the measles are much dreaded. When the venereal
disease has once settled, the sufferer seldom gets rid of it entirely;
applications of herbs are used, but as these people are unacquainted
with or unable to follow its proper mode of treatment, some of the patients
are crippled, and the major part of them never again enjoy good
health. The yaws also is to be met with; but I had afterwards
more opportunities of seeing this complaint, and will therefore not
now give any account of it. Instances of consumption occur. The
hooping-cough did not appear to be known in any part of the
country which I visited; I made many inquiries respecting it, but
could not obtain any information upon the subject. I slept many
times in the open air, and never felt any bad effects from so doing.
The dew is trifling, and a high wind is usual in the night. The sun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
is powerful, and is of course particularly felt in travelling over sandy
loose soil; but it did not seem to do any mischief. I never suffered
from head-ache, and excepting the attack of the ague, which is
accounted for from the heavy rain which we experienced, I never enjoyed
better health.</p>

<p>The food of the inhabitants of the Sertam consists chiefly of meat,
of which they make three meals; and to this is added the flour of
the mandioc stirred up into paste, or rice sometimes supplies its
place. The bean, which is commonly called in England the French
bean, is a favourite food; it is suffered to run to seed, and is only
plucked up when quite dry and hard. I have often been surprised to
see of how little service maize is to them as food, but yet it is occasionally
used. In default of these, the paste of the carnàûba is made;
and I have seen meat eaten with curds. Of green vegetables they
know nothing, and they laugh at the idea of eating any kind of salad.
The wild fruits are numerous, and to be obtained in any quantities,
but few species are cultivated; among the latter are the water-melon
and the plantain. The cheese of the Sertam, when it is fresh,
is excellent; but after four or five weeks, it becomes hard and tough.
Some few persons make butter, by shaking the milk in a common
black bottle, but this must of course be experimental, and not general.
In the towns even of the Sertam, rancid Irish butter is the only kind
which is to be obtained. Wherever the lands admit of it, these
people plant mandioc, rice, &amp;c. but much, I may say the greater part
of the vegetable portion of their food, is brought either from more
fertile districts near to the coast, or from the settlements still further
back,&mdash;the vallies and skirts of the Cariris, Serra do Teixeira, and
other inland mountains.</p>

<p>The trade of the Sertam consists in receiving small quantities of
European manufactured goods<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>; the cotton cloth of the country, of
which they make some among themselves; a small portion of European<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
white earthenware, and considerable quantities of the dark
brown ware of the country, which is made for the most part by the
Indians who live in the districts that contain the proper kind of
clay; rum in small casks; butter, tobacco, snuff, sugar or treacle
made up in cakes, spurs, bits for bridles, and other gear for their
horses, excepting the saddles, of which the greater part are made in
their own districts; gold and silver ornaments also find a market to
a certain amount. The pedlars travel about from village to village,
and from one estate to another, bartering their commodities for cattle
of all kinds, cheese, and hides of horned cattle. A colt of from two to
three years, sells for about one guinea; a horse broken in for the
pack-saddle, for two or three guineas; a horse broken in for mounting,
from five to six guineas. A bullock of two years, ten shillings;
a full grown ox, one guinea and a half; a cow varies much, according
to the quantity of milk, from one guinea to five guineas. A
sheep, from two to three shillings; a goat for slaughter is worth even
less, but a good milch goat is valued at one guinea, and sometimes
higher. Children are frequently suckled by goats, which increases
the value of these animals. The goat that has been so employed
always obtains the name of <i>comadre</i>, the term which is made use of
between the mother and godmother of a child; and so general is this,
that she-goats are frequently called <i>comadres</i>, without having had the
honour of suckling a young master or mistress. Dogs are sometimes
valued at from one to two guineas, and even higher, if they are good
sporting, or good house and baggage-dogs. A fowl is as dear as a
sheep or goat; and in one instance, as has been related, I paid four
times the money for one of these birds that I had given for a kid.
The hawkers seldom obtain money in exchange for their wares; they
take whatever is offered, and hire people to assist in conveying the
cattle or produce to a market, where they are exchanged for goods,
and then the owner again returns. A twelvemonth is sometimes passed
in turning over the property once; but the profits are usually enormous;
two or three hundred <i>per cent.</i></p>

<p>During my stay at Natal, the governor shewed me a species of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
wax which is produced from the leaves of the carnàûba, a tree I have
frequently mentioned. A quantity of this wax was sent by him to
Rio de Janeiro; it is mentioned in one of Dr. Arruda’s publications,
and a sample of it found its way to England, and has been taken
notice of by the Royal Society<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>. The governor, in one of his journeys
through his province, passed the night, as often happened, in a
peasant’s cottage. A wax candle was lighted and placed before him,
which was rudely made, but afforded a good light; he was somewhat
surprised at this, because oil is generally used; on making enquiry,
he found out that the wax dropped from the leaves which covered the
cottage, during the heat of the day;&mdash;I suppose the cottage had been
newly built, or that a fresh covering of leaves had been put on to it.
He afterwards made the experiment himself, tried some of the
candles, and became confident of the importance of the vegetable
wax. The governor also gave me a piece of iron ore, which was the
produce of the captaincy of Rio Grande. He told me that he entertained
little doubt of the existence of considerable quantities of this
metal in this part of the country, and that the Government would be
well recompensed for their trouble, if proper persons were appointed
for the purpose of making discoveries on this subject. I saw some
cloth which he had ordered to be woven from the thread of the
crauatâ<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>. Its texture was not unlike that of the coarse linen which
is used for sheeting; it is very strong. I have some of the thread
in my possession.</p>

<p>As soon as I had arranged that I should leave Natal in the morning
of the 6th February, the governor told me that he intended setting
off on business relating to his province at the same time. We
took leave of each other at night, and in the morning when I rose, I
found myself in possession of the house, as he had set out at four
o’clock. We did not get away until about seven, owing to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
number of horses’ loads, and other matters which it was necessary to
arrange. I felt quite at home at Natal, though I was yet distant from
Recife seventy leagues; but the country is well watered, well wooded,
and comparatively well peopled.</p>

<p>I passed again through St. Joze, the Indian village, but did not
turn off from the road towards Papari. I slept at a hamlet, and in
the morning proceeded to Cunhàû. About ten o’clock we were
under the necessity of turning loose, and leaving behind upon one of
the plains, a horse which I had purchased at Chafaris; he was completely
fagged, and could not proceed farther. The colonel of Cunhàû
was not at home, but his steward wished me to make use of his
master’s house; however, I merely mentioned having left a horse at
some distance upon the lands of the plantation, and the guide drew
for his government the mark which it had upon the haunch. I
have often observed the quickness of these people in recognising
a mark which they have once seen, and the accuracy with which
they will draw it after having only taken seemingly a casual glance,
and perhaps after a period of some weeks has elapsed since they had
had even this<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>. We then rode on half a league to the hamlet. The
commandant of this place introduced himself to me, and was extremely
civil; he put my horse into his stable and wished me to stay
until the following morning, but I preferred advancing, and slept the
same night at another hamlet two leagues beyond. This day we
passed several rivulets which were all much swollen, but none of them
were sufficiently full to prevent the continuance of our journey. There
had already been some rain, and the face of the country bore a more
pleasing appearance. Two letter-carriers passed through the place in
the evening, and I wrote by them to a friend at Pernambuco, that
the cottage at the Cruz das Almas might be ready for me on my arrival.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>The next day we passed some sugar plantations and over some
hills; the country was most beautiful, for every thing looked green
and healthy. I crossed a considerable rivulet at the foot of a hill,
and, ascending on the opposite side, put up at a single cottage,
which was inhabited by white people; an old man, a widower, with
a fine family of handsome sons and daughters. Their cottage had
not room for us all, and therefore we intended to sleep in the open
air altogether, but the old man insisted upon my going to sleep in
the house, and I was not sorry for this, being rather afraid of a
return of the ague. Nearly at sunset, or at the close of the day,
which in that country are almost about the same time, the tame
sheep was missing; great search was made for it, but to no purpose.
The old man ordered two of his sons to set out, and not to
return until every enquiry had been made in the neighbourhood. I
did all in my power to prevent giving this trouble, but he persisted,
saying, “No, you are under my roof, and this unfortunate circumstance
may lead you to have an unfavourable opinion of me.” Long
after dark the young men returned with the sheep and a mulatto
man in custody. I wished the man to be released, but they said
that this could not be, for he was a runaway slave, who had committed
many depredations, and for whose apprehension a considerable
reward was offered by his master. They had followed the footsteps
of the sheep upon a sandy path as long as the day-light lasted,
and then had taken a direction, which they thought might lead to
some <i>mocambos</i>, or huts of the wood, made by runaway slaves. After
they had proceeded a little way, the bleating of the sheep was heard,
upon which they prepared themselves and came suddenly upon this
fellow and a woman who were in a hut; the woman escaped, which
they regretted, as she was likewise most probably a runaway slave.
The man was taken into the house, and was tied fast upon a long
bench with his face downwards, and the cord was passed round his
arms and legs several times; this was done in the room which I was
to inhabit for the night. The whole of the family retired to rest,
and left us together; I had my knife with me, but naturally soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
fell asleep. In the morning the bench and the cords remained, but
the man was gone; he had crept through a small window at the opposite
end of the room. The young men of the house were sadly
vexed, but I told them it was their own fault, for some of them should
have kept watch, as they could not suppose that I should remain
awake, who had come in fatigued from travelling. We were now
afraid that he might have taken one of our horses for his more convenient
escape, but this was not the case.</p>

<p>Our journey took us again through the village of Mamanguape;
and a little distance beyond it, I left the road, accompanied by the
guide, and went to the principal house of a sugar plantation, where
we asked for a night’s lodging. I was told that the master was not
at home, and great doubts seemed to be entertained of taking us in.
Whilst we were talking at the door, a young man of dark colour came
up, mounted a horse which was standing there without a saddle, and
rode off, seemingly avoiding to observe that there were any strangers
present. One of the black women said, “Why did not you
speak to him, for he is one of our young masters.” I now enquired
and discovered that the owner of the place and his family were mulattos.
This was the only instance of incivility I met with, and the
only occasion on which a night’s lodging was denied to me during
the whole course of my stay in Brazil. We lodged this night under
a tree, distant about one hundred yards from the <i>engenho</i>, near to a
neat and comfortable looking cottage, of which the owner was an
elderly woman; she was civil to us, and expressed her sorrow at the
treatment which we had received. There had been very little rain
here, for the grass in the field of the plantation had still a parched
look, and the cattle were in bad condition.</p>

<p>Towards the evening of the following day we reached a hamlet, and
at one of the cottages I obtained permission to pass the night. There
was a pent-house standing out from the front; these are usual even
for dwellings of wealthy persons. Under it I slung my hammock,
but was surprised to find, that though the house was inhabited, still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
the door was shut, and that the person within spoke to us, but did not
open it. This I thought strange, and began to suppose that he might
be afflicted with some contagious disorder and had been forsaken by his
friends, or rather, that his family had been advised to remove to some
neighbouring cottage. But the guide explained, saying that the
man had been bitten by a snake, and that the bite of this species only
became fatal if the man who had received it saw any female animal,
and particularly a woman, for thirty days after the misfortune. As the
lower orders imagine that all snakes are poisonous, it is not surprising
that many remedies or charms should be quoted as efficacious. It is
well known that many of those reptiles are innoxious, but as this is
not believed by the people in general, it is naturally to be supposed
that any cause rather than the true one is ascribed on a recovery
from a bite.</p>

<p>On the morrow we left these good people in expectation of their
friend’s restoration to health at the allotted period, and proceeded to
dine on the banks of the river Paraiba, at a spot which was not far
distant from the plantation of Espirito Santo, where we had slept
on our way northwards. The river was still as dry as it had been
during the drought, that is, the pools or hollows in the bed of it had
water in them, but they did not contain a sufficient quantity to overflow,
unite, and form a stream. We arrived upon the banks about
ten o’clock, and heard from several persons of a report which had
been spread, that the river was filling fast. About twelve o’clock
the water made its appearance, and before we left it the river was
three feet deep. We afterwards heard that the stream was not fordable
at five o’clock of the same afternoon, and that it continued to
run with great rapidity for some days. I went round to Espirito
Santo and spoke to the <i>capitam-mor</i>, but did not dismount, as I was
more and more anxious to end my journey. We slept at a single
cottage about two leagues beyond, and on the following morning
again set forth. About noon, for I had pushed on without resting
until this hour, we were descending a long and steep hill, when a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
violent shower of rain came on, which soon caused a torrent to run
with much noise and velocity through the gullies in the road. The
clay of which the hill was composed was rendered excessively slippery,
and far from proceeding more quickly, the horses became more
cautious; and on these occasions it is needless to attempt to urge
them forwards faster than they themselves are willing to go; they are
aware of the danger of a false step, and nothing the rider can do will
make an old roadster alter his usual manner of proceeding. At the
foot of the hill stood a <i>venda</i> or liquor shop, at which travellers were
in the habit of putting up. Most of the hamlets contain one of these
places, and we had met with them much more frequently since we
had entered upon the great cattle road. Wet as we were, through
and through, it would have been impossible to go on further this day,
therefore we were thankful in having a house so near; indeed, the
rain continued during the greatest part of the afternoon. We had
descended into a narrow and beautiful valley, much of which was
covered with flourishing plantations of sugar cane, looking very green
and luxuriant. This was not the first night that I had seen the beautiful
luminous insect, <i>elater noctilucus</i>, which is called by the Portugueze
<i>cacafogo</i>. It is to be met with chiefly in well wooded lands,
and emits at intervals a strong but short lived light.</p>

<p>After leaving this place the next morning, we discovered that we
had lost some trifles belonging to our baggage. I sent the guide and
another man back to seek for them; but they returned unsuccessful.
We had, it is true, seldom taken up our lodgings in public houses,
but perhaps if we had done so oftener, I should have had more
reason to complain; however as it is, this was the only occasion
upon which I lost any part of my baggage, with a suspicion of theft
attached to its disappearing.</p>

<p>We rested at mid-day near Dous Rios, and in the afternoon passed
through that place, arriving at Goiana about sunset. It will be
remembered that I purchased some of my horses at Goiana; now on
my return, two of the same animals were still with me, and this alone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
proves that they were of the best kind. When we were distant from
Goiana about one league, one of them made towards a narrow path
to the right of the road, and was prevented by his driver from turning
up into it, but immediately after passing it, he began to flag, and
in a few minutes I was under the necessity of having him released
from his load, and of desiring one of the men to lead him, otherwise
he would have turned back. He had from this time the appearance
of being quite fatigued. I can only account for the circumstance by
supposing that the path led to his former master’s residence, and that
the animal had proceeded thus far in expectation of ending his
journey here.</p>

<p>I was received by my friends at Goiana in their usual friendly manner;
but I found that the town was in a dreadful state from the scarcity
of provisions. One person was said to have died of hunger, and I was
told by an inhabitant that several respectable women had been at
his house to beg for <i>farinha</i>, offering to pawn their gold ornaments
for it.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 15th February, I left Goiana, and assisted
my people in crossing the river. As soon as they were all safe on
the Recife side of it, I pushed on accompanied by Julio and Feliciano,
all three of us being mounted upon our best horses. We
rested during the heat of the day at Iguaraçu. My horse recognized
the place, for as he entered the town, he quickened his pace, and
without being guided, went up to the door of the inn, from whence
he refused to stir again until I dismounted. We arrived a little after
sunset at the Cruz das Almas. John was prepared for me, but did
not expect me for one or two days.</p>

<p>The following morning I rode to Recife, and was received by my
friends as one who had been somewhat despaired of; and even my
particular friend to whom I had written, did not expect me so soon.
When I returned home in the evening, the rest of the party had
arrived; and Feliciano and his two companions set off two days<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
afterwards on their return to Searà<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>. Julio likewise left me, with
which I was much displeased.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<p class="pch">VOYAGE FROM PERNAMBUCO TO MARANHAM.&mdash;ST. LUIZ.&mdash;TRADE.&mdash;WILD
INDIANS.&mdash;THE GOVERNOR.&mdash;ALCANTARA.&mdash;THE AUTHOR SAILS FROM ST.
LUIZ, AND ARRIVES IN ENGLAND.</p>

<p class="drop-cap06">EIGHT days after my return from Searà, arrived a vessel from
England, bringing letters which obliged me to leave Pernambuco
and proceed to Maranham. As a cargo could not be obtained
for the brig at the former place, the consignee determined to send her
to Maranham, and being myself desirous of taking advantage of the
first opportunity, I prepared for the voyage, and sailed in the course
of forty-eight hours.</p>

<p>We weighed anchor on the 25th February, and had a prosperous
passage of seven days. We were in sight of the land nearly the whole
time, and occasionally, as the brig was small, and the master wished
if possible to become acquainted with the points of land, we were
very near to it. The Portugueze ships seldom come up this coast
without a pilot, nor is it prudent to do otherwise; but we could not
obtain one without delay, to which the master objected. He had
scarcely ever before been out of the British seas; but their school is
good, and now he found his way to Maranham with as much dexterity
as an experienced pilot. This coast is generally known to be
dangerous; and the land has for the most part a dreary and dismal
look, particularly after passing Rio Grande. We entered the bay of
St. Marcos with the lead going, took the channel to the eastward of
the <i>baixo do meio</i> or middle bank, passed the Fort of St. Marcos, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
came to an anchor opposite and very near to the sand banks at the
mouth of the harbour of St. Luiz. As no pilot came off to us, the
master and myself got into the boat, intending to fetch one; but on
coming opposite to the Fort of St. Francisco, a gun without shot was
fired, and the sentinel beckoned us back to the ship. We pulled for
the fort, and when we approached it, an enormous speaking trumpet
was produced, and through it we received orders not to proceed to
the city. However we landed at the fort, and I told the officer that
the master was particularly desirous of having a pilot, as he was
unacquainted with the bay or port; but it is well known that they
contain many sand banks. We were answered that the pilot would
come in due time; and finding remonstrance of no avail, returned to
the ship. When the pilot arrived, he was accompanied by a soldier
and a custom-house officer. It was with some difficulty that I could
persuade the master to allow the former to come into the vessel.
Sailors and soldiers never very well agree, and the blunt Englishman
said that he had no idea of his ship being taken from him by a fellow
in a party-coloured jacket. This was a new regulation. Indeed in
most of those regarding the port of Maranham, I could not avoid
recollecting the old proverb of “much cry, &amp;c.” As the brig came
up the harbour, we received the health and custom-house visit. It
was composed of several well-dressed men, some of whom wore
cocked hats and swords; and all of them ate much bread and cheese,
and drank quantities of porter. The <i>administrador</i> of the customs
was among them, and was dressed in the uniform of a cavalry officer.
I scarcely ever saw so much astonishment pictured in the countenance
of any man as in that of the master of the brig. He had been accustomed
to enter our own ports, where so much business is done in so
quiet a manner; and he now said to me in half joke, half earnest,
“Why it is not only one, but they are coming in shoals to take the
ship from me.” After all these personages, and all the trouble they
had given us, I was still obliged to pass the night on board, because
the <i>guardamor</i>, the officer especially appointed to prevent smuggling,
had not made his visit. Fortunately, I found means of having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
the letters conveyed on shore, otherwise the vessel would have
arrived four and twenty hours before the merchant to whom she was
consigned, could have obtained any information regarding her. To
render the night still more agreeable, some heavy rain fell; the deck
was leaky, and about midnight I was obliged to rise and look for a
dry corner.</p>

<p>The city of St. Luiz, situated upon the island of Maranham, and
the metropolis of the <i>estado</i>, or state of Maranham, is the residence
of a captain-general and the see of a bishop. It is built upon very
unequal ground, commencing from the water’s edge, and extending
to the distance of about one mile and a half in a N.E. direction. The
space which it covers, ought to contain many more inhabitants than
is actually the case; but the city is built in a straggling manner, and
it comprises some broad streets and squares. This gives to it an airy
appearance, which is particularly pleasant in so warm a climate. Its
situation upon the western part of the island, and upon one side of a
creek, almost excludes it from the sea breeze, by which means the
place is rendered less healthy than if it was more exposed. The
population may be computed at about 12,000 persons or more, including
negroes, of which the proportion is great, being much more
considerable than at Pernambuco. The streets are mostly paved, but
are out of repair. The houses are many of them neat and pretty,
and of one story in height; the lower part of them is appropriated to
the servants, to shops without windows, to warehouses, and other purposes,
as at Pernambuco. The family lives upon the upper story, and
the windows of this reach down to the floor, and are ornamented with
iron balconies. The churches are numerous, and there are likewise
Franciscan, Carmelite, and other convents. The places of worship
are gaudily decorated in the inside; but no plan of architecture is
aimed at in the formation of the buildings themselves, with the exception
of the convents, which preserve the regular features appertaining
to such edifices. The governor’s palace stands upon rising
ground, not far from the water side, with the front towards the town.
It is a long uniform stone building of one story in height; the principal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
entrance is wide, but without a portico. The western end joins
the town-hall and prison, which appear to be part of the same edifice;
and the oblong piece of ground in its front, covered with grass,
gives to it on the whole a handsome and striking appearance. One
end of this is open to the harbour and to a fort in the hollow, close
to the water; the other extremity is nearly closed by the cathedral.
One side is almost taken up with the palace and other public buildings,
and the opposite space is occupied by dwelling-houses and
streets leading down into other parts of the city. The ground upon
which the whole place stands, is composed of a soft red stone; so
that the smaller streets leading from the town into the country, some
of which are not paved, are full of gullies, through which the water
runs in the rainy season. These streets are formed of houses consisting
only of the ground floor, and having thatched roofs; the windows
are without glass, and the dwellings have a most mean and shabby
appearance. The city contains a custom-house and treasury; the
former is small, but was quite large enough for the business of the
place, until lately.</p>

<p>The harbour is formed by a creek in the island, and is to be entered
from the bay of St. Marcos. The channel is of sufficient depth
for common sized merchant ships; but is very narrow, and not to
be entered without a pilot. Opposite to the town the water is
shallow at the ebb. It is worthy of remark, that the tide rises gradually
more and more along the coast of Brazil, from south to north.
Thus at Rio de Janeiro the rise is said to be trifling; at Pernambuco
it is from five to six feet; at Itamaraca eight feet; and at Maranham,
it is eighteen feet. The forts of Maranham are all of them said to be
in bad order. I heard one person observe, half in earnest, that he did
not suppose each fort contained more than four guns which were in
a fit state to be fired. I did not see that of St. Marcos, which
is situated at the entrance of the bay; but it is reported to be
in the same state as the others. Those I saw are small, and built
of stone. The soldiers were well dressed and well fed, and they
looked respectable. The barracks are new and large comparatively<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
speaking, and have been built in an airy situation, in the outskirts of
the city. The garrison consists of one regiment of regular infantry
of about one thousand men when complete; but these are much
divided, being stationed in several forts. Recruits are formed of the
lower orders of white persons, and of the people of colour. The men
were never exercised with the artillery, and were merely accustomed
to the common routine of mounting guard, though a few detachments
have on some occasions been sent on to the main land at the
back of the island, to assist the planters against the wild Indians.</p>

<p>The island of Maranham forms the S.E. side of the bay of St. Marcos,
consequently this bay is to the westward of it. To the eastward of the
island is the bay of St. Joze. From some similarity between the point
of Itacolomi, by which vessels are in part guided when about to enter
the bay of St. Marcos, and another point of land upon the small island
of St. Anna, which is at the entrance of the bay of St. Joze, instances
have occurred of vessels mistaking the latter for the former, and entering
the bay of St. Joze. This error causes great danger and inconvenience,
because owing to the prevalence of easterly winds, it is next
to impossible for a vessel to beat her way out of it. It is therefore
necessary that she should go through the narrow channel between
the main land and the island of Maranham, a passage of considerable
difficulty<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>. The bay of St. Marcos is spotted with several beautiful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
islands, and is of sufficient extent to admit of considerable grandeur.
The width from St. Luiz to the opposite shore is between four and
five leagues; its length is much greater; towards the south end there
are several sand banks, and the water is shallower. It receives here
the waters of a river, along the banks of which are situated several
cattle estates, but the river Itapicuru, which runs into the narrow
channel between the main land and the island, enjoys the greatest
share of cultivation; its banks are extremely fertile, and upon them
have been established the principal plantations of cotton and rice,
which are the two chief and almost only articles of commerce from
the city of St. Luiz. The island is in itself very little cultivated.
There is no considerable plantation upon it. A few of the rich merchants
residing in the city have country houses distant from it about
one league, but the remainder of the lands are left untouched, owing,
as is said, to the unfitness of the soil for the purposes of agriculture<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
There is a horse-path through the island to a house which stands
immediately opposite to the mouth of the river Itapicuru; at this is
stationed a canoe, for the purpose of conveying people from one
shore to the other. Another horse-path also leads to the village and
chapel of St. Joze.</p>

<p>The importance of the province has increased very rapidly. Previous
to the last sixty years no cotton was exported, and I heard that
when the first parcel was about to be shipped, a petition was made by
several of the inhabitants to the <i>Camara</i> or municipality, requesting
that the exportation might not be permitted, for otherwise they feared
that there would be a want of the article for the consumption of the
country; this of course was not attended to, and now the number of
bags exported annually is between forty and fifty thousand, averaging
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>about 180 lbs. weight each<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>. The quantity of rice grown
there is likewise great<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>; but the sugar which is required for the consumption
of the province is brought from the ports to the southward.
Some sugar cane has lately been planted, but hitherto
molasses only have been made. I heard many persons say, that
the lands are not adapted to the growth of the sugar cane<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>. The
cotton and rice are brought to St. Luiz in barks of about 25 or
30 tons burthen. These come down the rivers with the stream
from the plantations; their return is not however so easy, as they are
obliged to be rowed or warped, but being then empty, or nearly so,
the difficulty is not very great.</p>

<p>Considerable quantities of manufactured goods have been sent out
from Great Britain since the opening of the trade, as has been done
to the other principal ports upon the coast; but a ready sale has not
been found for them here to any great amount. The province of
Maranham will not bear comparison with that of Pernambuco. It
is still in an infant state; there still exist wild Indians, and the
plantations upon the main land are still in danger from their attacks.
The proportion of free persons is much smaller; the slaves very
much preponderate, but this class can of necessity use but little of
what is in any degree expensive, of what in such a climate is mere
luxury. There exists at St. Luiz a great inequality of ranks; the
chief riches of the place are in the hands of a few men who possess
landed property to a great extent, numerous gangs of slaves, and are
also merchants. The wealth of these persons and the characters of
some of the individuals who enjoy it, have raised them to great
weight and consequence, and indeed one governor knows to his cost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
that without their concurrence it was useless to attempt the introduction
of the innovations proposed, and impossible to trample long
upon the rest of the community. But the great inequality of rank
bespeaks the advancement of this place to have been less rapid than
that of other settlements further south, where the society is more
amalgamated, and property more divided. As a port of trade with
Europe, St. Luiz may be accounted the fourth establishment upon
the coast of Brazil in point of importance, giving precedence to Rio
de Janeiro, Bahia, and Pernambuco.</p>

<p>The wild Indians have occasionally crossed from the main land
to the island, and have committed depredations upon the houses
and gardens in the neighbourhood of St. Luiz. Some of these people
have been at different times made prisoners and brought to the
town, where very little pains, I fear, have been taken to conciliate
them. I did not see any of them, but they were represented to me
as most frightful beings; their features are excessively ugly, and their
hair is black and preposterously long, both before and behind. They
are of a dark copper colour, darker than Indians that have been
domesticated. The last individuals taken, to the number of four or
five, were brought into the town quite naked, were put into close
confinement, and I was informed that there they died. I could not find
out that any attempt had been made to send them back as mediators,
or that any plan of conciliation had been entered into; and on mentioning
something of this kind, I was in more than one instance told that
it would be of no use, that rigour was the only method. I do not
think that this is the general opinion regarding them, but I much apprehend
that, but faint hopes can be entertained of any zeal being
shown for their civilization. There are now no enthusiastic missionaries;
the Jesuits no longer exist in that country, and the other
orders of friars have become lazy and worse than useless. However
the Indians cannot be enslaved; therefore, at least, they are not hunted
down like wild cattle, as formerly was the practice. The name which
is given generally both here and at Pernambuco to all wild Indians
is <i>Tapuya</i>; and that of <i>Caboclo</i> is applied to those who have been
domesticated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>Having thus given an outline of the place at which I had arrived,
I may now leave my quarters on board the brig and be allowed to
land, which I accomplished on the morning subsequent to that of our
entrance into the harbour. I was received upon the quay by my
friend, a young Portugueze with whom I had been intimate in England
and at Pernambuco. He told me it was necessary to go to
the palace, for the purpose of presenting my passport, as the regulations
of the port had for some time been most strictly followed, and
several indeed had been lately added. I then, for the first time, recollected
that I had no passport, having forgotten to obtain one, owing to
the haste with which I left Pernambuco. This produced a demur, as
my friend was afraid that I should be imprisoned, the governor not
being friendly to Englishmen; however I determined to call myself
the supercargo of the brig. We proceeded to the palace, the entrance
to which was guarded by two sentinels, and we passed several
others in going up the stairs into the anti-chamber, where we were
received by a gentlemanlike officer, who heard what I had to say,
asked no questions, and soon dismissed us. I thought I had seen the
great man himself, but was undeceived, and heard that he seldom
honoured any one with an audience. The officer to whom we had
spoken was the lieutenant-colonel of the regiment of regular infantry.
The guard at the palace consisted of one company; the muskets were
piled in front of the chief entrance and appeared to be in good order.</p>

<p>I soon discovered that St. Luiz was ruled with most despotic sway;
the people were afraid of speaking, as no man knew how soon it
might be his fate to be arrested, from some trifling expression which
he might allow to escape him. The governor was so tenacious of
the honours due to his situation, that he required every person who
crossed the area in front of the palace to remain uncovered until he
had entirely passed the whole building. Not that the governor was
himself always in view, but this adoration was thought necessary even
to the building within which he dwelt. The distinction, until then
reserved, by the Romish church for its highest dignitaries, was however
not thought by His Excellency too exalted for himself; the bells
of the cathedral rang every time he went out in his carriage. Persons,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
even of the first rank in the place, were to stop, if in their carriages
or on horseback, when they met him, and were to allow him
to pass before they were again to move forwards.</p>

<p>I was introduced to several of the first merchants and planters, and
particularly to the Colonels Joze Gonçalvez da Silva and Simplicio
Dias da Silva; the latter is the sub-governor of Parnaiba, a small
port situated about three degrees to the eastward of St. Luiz. They
are both of them men of great wealth and of independent spirit. The
former is an elderly man who has made a large fortune in trade, and
latterly has increased it in planting cotton. He possesses between
1000 and 1500 slaves. On one occasion the mulatto driver of his carriage,
though ordered by his master to stop, that the governor might
pass, refused so to do. The following day an officer came to the old
gentleman’s house with orders to arrest the man. The colonel sent for
him and said, “Go, and I’ll take care of you,” adding to the officer,
“tell His Excellency I have still several other drivers.” To the
surprise of every person about the prison, two servants made their
appearance in the evening with a tray, covered with a cloth which
was handsomely embroidered, and filled with the best kinds of victuals;
sweetmeats, &amp;c. were not forgotten. All this was for the
driver, and was repeated three times every day until the man received
an order for his release.</p>

<p>The Colonel Simplicio had been sent for by the governor to
St. Luiz. Had it not been for the circumstances in which he was
placed, I should have gone down to his residence at Parnaiba; he
has there a most noble establishment, part of which consists of a
band of musicians, who are his own slaves; some of them have been
instructed at Lisbon and at Rio de Janeiro. It is through such men
as these that improvements are to be expected. I likewise became
acquainted with a gentleman who had been imprisoned for a trifling
breach of some new port regulation. Any of his friends were allowed
free ingress to see him, and I passed some pleasant evenings with
him and other persons who were in the habit of assembling there;
he was allowed two small rooms in the prison, and was confined in
this manner for several months. The <i>Ouvidor</i> of the province was
also suspended from exercising the functions of his office, was removed
from St. Luiz, and imprisoned in one of the forts. The <i>Juiz de Fora</i>,
the second judicial officer, performed for the time the duties of the
situation; he was a Brazilian, and a man of independent character,
who spoke and acted freely, notwithstanding the ostensible place he
held, and the danger of it under such a government. The master
of an English merchant ship, I was told, had been arrested for some
breach of port regulation, and was confined in a miserable dungeon
for three days. I heard many more stories of the same nature; but
these will, I think, suffice to shew the state of the city of St. Luiz at
the time and just before I visited that place.</p>

<p>The governor was a very young man, and a member of one of the
first noble families of Portugal<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>. There are few situations in which
it is so greatly in a man’s power to be much beloved or much disliked
as that of governor of a province in Brazil; in which a man
may be either the benefactor or the scourge of the people over whom
he is sent to rule.</p>

<p>My friend’s residence, in which I staid during my visit to Maranham,
was situated by the water side, and almost within hail of the
ships at anchor in the harbour. I was amused sometimes at the
rapidity with which the fishermen paddled their canoes; these are
long and of just width sufficient to allow of two men sitting
abreast. I have seen in one of them as many as sixteen men
in two rows, with each a paddle, which they move with quickness and
great regularity. The last men upon the bench steer the canoe when
necessary, placing the paddle so as to answer the purpose of a rudder;
one or other of the two men steering, according to the direction
which the vessel is to take. These fellows are mostly dark-coloured
mulattos and blacks, and are entirely naked excepting the
hats which they wear upon their heads; but when they come on
shore, they partially cloath themselves. The print will give some
idea of the strange appearance which they make. The nakedness of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
the negro slaves is also not sufficiently concealed; neither males nor
females have any covering from the waist upwards, excepting on
Sundays and holidays. Though the climate may not require any
more cloathing, decency certainly does. I speak here of slaves who
are at work in the streets, for the household servants are at least
tolerably covered, and some of them are neatly and even gaudily
dressed. At Pernambuco, the slaves are always decently cloathed.
The criminals who are to be seen chained together, as at Pernambuco,
are here more numerous; and in walking the streets, the clanking
of the chains is continually striking the ear, reminding every man
of the state of the government under which he resides. Such is the
power of a governor, that a respectable person might be sentenced
to this dreadful punishment, at least until redress could be obtained
from the seat of the supreme government at Rio de Janeiro, a period
of four months or more intervening.</p>

<p>I brought with me the horse which had carried me as far as Rio
Grande on my journey to Searà, and took several rides in the neighbourhood
of the city, with an English gentleman who was residing
there. The roads are extremely bad, even in the immediate vicinity
of St. Luiz, and our usual practice was to ride several times round
the open piece of ground upon which the barracks stand. Maranham
is again in this respect far behind the place I had lately left;
the number of country houses is small; the paths are few, and no care
is taken of them. Notwithstanding this, several persons have carriages,
which are of a form similar to those used in Lisbon, and
not unlike the cabriolets drawn by a pair of horses, which are to be
seen in France and Flanders. The horses that may be purchased at
St. Luiz are small, and few of them are well formed. Grass is
scarce, and the inducements to take exercise on horseback are so few,
that the number of these animals upon the island is not considerable;
this too may be one cause why fine horses are not to be
met with there; for if a ready sale was found for the beasts of this
description, some would, doubtless, be carried from Piauhi to Maranham,
which might be done with almost as little difficulty as is experienced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
in conveying many of them from the interior of Pernambuco
to Recife.</p>

<p>An English gentleman with whom I was acquainted, arrived
at Maranham, a short time after the opening of the trade to
British shipping; he was riding in the vicinity of the city one
afternoon, when he was accosted by an old woman, who said
that she had heard of the arrival of an Englishman, and wished to
know if it was true, as she was going to St. Luiz, and much desired
to see this <i>bicho</i> or animal. After some further conversation
upon the subject, he told her that the <i>bicho</i> she was speaking to, was
the Englishman himself. Of the truth of this, some difficulty was
found in persuading her; but when she was confident that it was so,
she cried out, “<i>Ai tam bonito</i>,” O, how handsome. She expected to
have been shown some horridly ugly beast, which it was dangerous to
approach, and was consequently agreeably surprised to find that she
was mistaken, and to see flesh and blood in human form, handsomely
put together.</p>

<p>I nearly lost a number of books which I had brought with me; the
box containing them was carried to the custom-house; they were
taken out, and I was desired to translate each title-page, which I did.
Though the works were chiefly historical, still I found that the officer
who looked over them, was not inclined to let me have them, and a
hint was given to me by one of my acquaintance, that they might be
considered as irrecoverable; however I made immediately a petition
to the governor, to be allowed to send them on board again; this was
granted, and thus I regained possession. If I had delayed, I am
almost certain that I should not have seen them again. Such
are the difficulties which are experienced with books in the parts
of Brazil which I visited, that the only resource which remains is
that of smuggling them into the country<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>. I hope, however, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
the enlightened minister who is now at the head of affairs, at Rio de
Janeiro, will put an end to this dreadful bar to improvement.</p>

<p>I brought a letter from one of my acquaintance at Pernambuco to a
gentleman who resided at Alcantara, a town on the opposite side of the
bay of St. Marcos. My friend at St. Luiz, another young Portugueze, and
myself, accompanied by two servants, agreed to hire a vessel and go
over, for the purpose of making him a visit, and of seeing the place.
We hired a small bark, and set sail one morning early, with a fair but
light wind. The beauties of the bay are only to be seen in crossing
it; the number of islands diversify the view every five minutes, from
the discovery of some hidden point, or from a change in the form of
the land, owing to the progress of the boat. The entrance into the
harbour of Alcantara, the town itself, and the size of the vessel in
which we were, reminded me much of the models of these realities.
The place, the port, and our boat were all small, and of proportionate
dimensions, having much the appearance of play-things. It was not
like a small vessel entering a large harbour; for in our case, as there
was but little water upon the bar, as much pilotage was necessary as
with a large ship in coming to anchor at St. Luiz. We were about
five hours in reaching the end of our voyage. The boatmen obtained
for us a small cottage, near to the beach; we intended to be independent,
and have our victuals cooked by our own servants; but soon
after we were settled in our new habitation, the gentleman introduced
himself to whom we were furnished with a letter. He said
that he had heard of our arrival, and he insisted upon our removal to
his house.</p>

<p>The town is built upon a semi-circular hill, and at first sight from
the port is very pretty; but it falls short of its promise on a nearer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
examination. The houses are many of them of one story in height,
and are built of stone; but the major part have only the ground floor.
It extends back to some distance in a straggling manner, with
gardens, and large spaces between each house; and many of the
habitations in that situation are thatched, and some of them are out
of repair. As the hill which rises from the water side is not high,
and the land beyond rather declines in a contrary direction, the
meaner part of the town is not seen at the first view. Alcantara is
however a thriving place, and its importance increases rapidly as the
lands in the neighbourhood are in request for cotton plantations.
A handsome stone quay was building upon the inside of a neck of
land, round which the harbour extends for small craft. The place
contains a town-hall and prison, and several churches.</p>

<p>The evening we passed with our new friend and his partner, both of
whom were pleasant men. The latter took us to a neighbouring church,
to hear a famous preacher, and to see all the fashion and beauty of the
place. It was much crowded, and therefore we saw little or nothing of
the congregation; but the preacher, a large handsome Franciscan friar,
with a fine toned and clear voice, delivered a very florid discourse,
with much energy and animation. This man and one other were the
only persons of those I heard preach in Brazil, who deviated from
the common praises usually given to the Virgin and to the Saints.
It was a good practical sermon, inculcating moral duties; but by way
of conformity to established custom, he now and then mentioned
the worthy in whose honour the festival was given<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>. The next
day was agreeably passed in conversation; and in the evening two
guitars were introduced, and some of the young men of the place
came in, and added to the amusement of the party; they sang and
played, and there was much sport. There was no ceremony; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
the behaviour of these people was gentlemanly, and their conversation
entertaining.</p>

<p>I heard here of a certain estate, of which the slaves were numerous,
but they had become rebellious; more than one steward had been
killed by them, and for some time they remained without any person
to direct them, but still they did not leave the place. When things
had gone on in this manner for some time, a native of Portugal presented
himself to the proprietor of the estate, and offered to take
charge of it if he would allow him a salary of one <i>conto</i> of <i>reis</i>, about
250<i>l.</i> annually (which is an enormous stipend); and if he would sign
an agreement by which he should not become responsible for any
slaves who might be killed in reducing the remainder to obedience.
To all this no objection was made; and the man set off, accompanied
by two other persons, his friends, and a guide, all of them being well
provided with fire arms and ammunition. They arrived upon the
scene of action one evening, and finding the door of the principal
house open, took up their lodgings in it. In the morning, several of
the negroes, on discovering the intentions of the persons who were
in possession of the house, assembled in the area in front of it, but at
some little distance. The new steward soon came to the door unarmed,
not permitting his companions to appear, and called to one of
the ring-leaders by name, as if nothing was amiss. The man
answered and came out of the group, but said that he would not approach
any nearer than the spot to which he had advanced. The
steward made no reply, but quickly took a loaded musket, which
stood immediately within the door, fired, and brought the man to the
ground, and without delay, called to another of the slaves also by
name. No answer being given, his companions came forwards, and
all of them fired in among the slaves. Such was the effect of this
summary manner of proceeding, that in two or three days all was
quiet, and went on smoothly as had formerly been the case; a few
only of the slaves absconding.</p>

<p>On our return from Alcantara we had a disagreeable passage, as the
wind blew hard and some heavy rain fell, which made us apprehensive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
of not being able to fetch the harbour of St. Luiz. Our vessel had
no cabin, but she was decked, and therefore as a matter of necessity
we crept into the hold, in which we could not stand upright, and the
bilge water occasionally reached our feet; but this produced much
laughter, and we ultimately arrived in safety. Not far from the mouth
of the port of Alcantara stands an island of three miles in length
and about one in breadth, called the <i>Ilha do Livramento</i>; it is inhabited
by one man and woman, who have under their care a chapel
dedicated to Our Lady of Deliverance, which is visited by the inhabitants
of the neighbouring shores, once every year for the purpose
of celebrating by a festival this Invocation of the Virgin. My departure
from Maranham sooner than I had purposed at first, prevented
the fulfilment of my intention of landing and spending a day
upon this spot. I know not what idea I might have formed of the
island if I had more narrowly examined it, but the view I had of it
at a distance was extremely beautiful. From what I heard of it, I
think, that if any one was about to settle at Maranham, here it is that
he should try to fix his residence.</p>

<p>I was introduced by my friend to a respectable family of St. Luiz.
We made them a visit one evening without invitation as is the custom,
and were ushered into a tolerably sized room, furnished with a
large bed, and three handsomely worked hammocks, which were
slung across in different directions; there were likewise in the apartment
a chest of drawers and several chairs. The mistress of the
house, an elderly lady, was seated in a hammock, and a female
visitor in another, but her two daughters and some male relations
sat upon chairs. The company, which consisted of two or three
men besides ourselves, formed a semicircle towards the hammocks.
There was much ceremony, and the conversation was carried on
chiefly by the men, and an occasional remark was made by one or
other of the old ladies. An answer was given by the daughters to
a question asked, but no more, and some of the subjects touched
upon would not have been tolerated in mixed society in England.
A part of the formality might perhaps have worn off on further acquaintance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
The education however of women is not attended to,
which of necessity curtails the possibility of their entering into conversation
upon many subjects, even if so to do was accounted proper.
Still the ladies of St. Luiz cannot be said to be generally thus
reserved, for gaming among both sexes is much practised, and is
carried to great excess. A young lady in one instance, when going
out with her mother to some evening company, passed through the
apartment in which her father was at play with several of his acquaintance.
He spoke to his daughter, asking her to take a card, which
she did. She went on playing until she had lost three hundred
<i>mil reis</i>, about 80<i>l.</i>, and then said she had no more money. A fresh
supply was afforded to her, and she accompanied her mother to their
party, where most probably play was likewise the entertainment of
the evening. Dancing is an amusement much too violent for the
climate, and is only resorted to on some grand occasion. The love
of gaming may be easily accounted for where there is little or no
taste for reading, and great sums of money are amassed without any
means of expending them. Living is cheap; a fine house, a carriage,
and a number of servants may be had for a small sum. The opening
of the trade has however given to these people a new turn of
expenditure, in the facility of obtaining articles of dress and furniture.</p>

<p>Two English merchants only were established at St. Luiz; the
commercial transactions of British houses of trade were entrusted
chiefly to Portugueze merchants of the place<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>. Many of these were
accustomed to little ceremony, and walked the streets in short jackets,
some of them were without neckcloths and a few without stockings;
but others dress according to the manner of persons in Europe.
It was with much difficulty that I could persuade the generality of
those with whom I conversed that I had no business to transact; they
could not comprehend the motive by which a man could be actuated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
who was putting himself, by travelling, to certain inconveniences
for the sake of amusement; indeed many persons would not
be convinced, and thought that in so saying I had some sinister
views.</p>

<p>I had not many opportunities of gaining information respecting
the interior, but still I will mention what I heard. The banks of the
river Itapicuru, of which I have already spoken, though they are much
cultivated compared to what they were a few years ago, are yet very
wild, and there is space incalculable for new colonists. The captaincy
of Piauhi and the interior of the State of Maranham abound in
cattle, and these parts of the country are not subject to droughts.
The town of Aldeas Altas<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>, which is situated in the latter, and the
city of Oeiras in the former and further inland, are said to be flourishing
places. Great numbers of cattle are annually driven from these
quarters of the Sertam to Bahia and Pernambuco. The proprietors
of the estates which are situated in districts so far removed from the
seat of government are at times unruly, and a party of soldiers, which
was sent up to arrest one of these men, some time before I arrived
at St. Luiz, returned without effecting its purpose.</p>

<p>Among other anecdotes, I heard of a mulatto slave who ran away
from his master, and in the course of years had become a wealthy
man, by the purchase of lands which were overrun with cattle. He
had, on one occasion, collected in pens great numbers of oxen which
he was arranging with his herdsmen to dispatch to different parts
for sale, when a stranger who came quite alone made his appearance,
and rode up and spoke to him, saying that he wished to have
some private conversation with him. After a little time they retired
together, and when they were alone the owner of the estate said,
“I thank you for not mentioning the connection between us, whilst
my people were present.” It was his master, who had fallen into distressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
circumstances, and had now made this visit in hopes of obtaining
some trifle from him. He said that he should be grateful for any
thing his slave chose to give to him. To reclaim him, he well knew,
was out of the question&mdash;he was in the man’s power, who might
order him to be assassinated immediately. The slave gave his master
several hundred oxen, and directed some of his men to accompany
him with them to a market, giving out among his herdsmen
that he had thus paid a debt of old standing for which he had only
now been called upon. A man who could act in this manner well
deserved the freedom which he had resolved to obtain.</p>

<p>As it was my intention to pass the ensuing summer in England, and
no ships arrived from thence, I was afraid of being delayed some months
for a conveyance, therefore I thought it better to take my passage in
one of the ships which were about to sail. I preferred the Brutus,
as I was intimate with the supercargo, a young Portugueze. We set
sail from St. Luiz on the 8th of April, in company of another British
ship; but we were soon out of sight of each other, owing to one vessel
holding a better wind. On the 18th we reached variable winds,
in lat. 22° N. lon. 50° W. It is not usual to find them so far to
the southwards, therefore we might consider ourselves remarkably
fortunate. We passed our time pleasantly, as the weather was fine
and the wind favourable. On the 7th of May, the wind freshened,
but we had a good ship and plenty of sea-room. A wave struck the
stern and entered the cabin on the 8th in the morning, setting every
thing afloat; this occurred soon after we had risen. On the 9th we
discovered two vessels at a great distance a-head and rather to windward,
both of them were laying to, but soon each appeared to stand
on different tacks. One proved to be an English brig loaded with
timber; she was water-logged and about to sink, and the latter was
an American ship, which had lain to, and was in the act of assisting
the people in leaving her. If the brig had not been loaded with timber
she must have gone down long before. As the American ship
was bound to her own country, we took the crew on board the
Brutus, nine persons; they were in most woeful plight; some lame,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
others nearly naked, and all of them half starved with cold and hunger.
The vessel had sprung a leak, which increased so rapidly, as to
oblige them to retreat from the deck into the foretop, where they
had been for three days and two nights, almost destitute of
provisions.</p>

<p>We arrived safe off Falmouth on the 20th of May. Here the
supercargo and myself landed, and proceeded to London.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER X.</h2>

<p class="pch">THE AUTHOR SETS SAIL FROM GRAVESEND AND ARRIVES AT PERNAMBUCO.&mdash;STATE
OF RECIFE.&mdash;JOURNEY TO BOM JARDIM WITH A CAPITAM-MOR,
AND RETURN TO RECIFE.</p>

<p class="drop-cap15">AT the commencement of the winter my friends again recommended
a return to a more temperate climate than that of
England; and therefore understanding that the Portugueze ship
Serra Pequeno was upon the point of sailing, I took my passage in
her. She was lying at Gravesend, and on the 4th October, 1811,
I embarked again for Pernambuco.</p>

<p>Contrary winds detained the ship at Portsmouth for about six
weeks. On the 20th November, the wind came round to the northward
and eastward, and the signal guns from the ships of war, appointed
as convoys, awakened us. All was bustle and confusion at Cowes,
where great numbers of persons, belonging to the ships, who were
circumstanced as we were, had stationed themselves. In a few hours
the vessels were under weigh, and before the night closed in, all of
them had cleared the Needles. The Serra Pequeno and other
Portugueze ships had taken instructions from a frigate, which
was bound to the Mediterranean, intending to keep company with
her as far as her destination and their’s obliged them to follow the
same course; but in the morning we discovered that we were with
another frigate, which was bound to Lisbon. We soon left her, and
were accompanied by other two Portugueze ships. On the night of
the 22d, we fell in with the Kangaroo sloop of war, which was bound
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>to the coast of Africa, with a few vessels under convoy. On the
24th we parted from this convoy, and on the 26th proceeded with
only one Portugueze ship. Our passage was most prosperous; we
had no boisterous weather, and few calms. On the 3d December,
we fell in with the Arethusa frigate, when in sight of the Canary
islands. The captain of the Serra was obliged to take the papers of
his ship on board the frigate. The regulations regarding the slave
trade, which is carried on by the Portugueze, perhaps occasioned
more enquiry than would otherwise have been deemed necessary.
We crossed the line on the 22d. In the evening of the 26th we
stood for the land, supposing that we had reached the latitude of our
port, but that we were much to the eastward of it; however, we
made the land about two o’clock in the morning, which was sooner
by several hours than the officers of the ship imagined we should.
This frequently occurs on board of those vessels which do not carry
chronometers; the calculation of longitude without their assistance
being of course rendered extremely liable to error. At day-break, it
was discovered that we were somewhat to the northward of Olinda.
We entered the port about nine o’clock, and came to anchor in the
lower harbour called the Poço.</p>

<p>The Serra Pequeno is one of the heavy deep-waisted Brazil ships,
requiring a great number of hands to manage her. The business of
the ship was carried on in a manner similar in almost all points to
that which is practised on board of British merchant vessels; there
was however less cleanliness observed, and more noise was made.
The second officer, who is called in the British merchant service
the mate, bears in Portugueze vessels that of pilot; and the
regulations of their marine confine him to the navigation of the ship,
giving up to an inferior officer the duty of attending to the discharging
or stowage of the hold when loading or unloading, and all other
minutiæ of the affairs either at sea or in a harbour.</p>

<p>I was received on shore by all those persons with whom I had
before had the pleasure of being acquainted, with the same friendliness
which I always experienced at Pernambuco. Several
English gentlemen offered me an apartment in their houses, until I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
obtained one of my own. I accepted the offer which was made to
me by him through whose great kindness my health had been so
much benefited, after the severe attack of fever which I had suffered
in the preceding year. The first few weeks were passed in visits to
my friends and acquaintance, with some of whom I occasionally staid
a few days in the neighbourhood of the town, which was now much
deserted, according to the usual custom, at this season of the year.</p>

<p>I perceived a considerable difference in the appearance of Recife
and of its inhabitants, although I had been absent from the place for
so short a period. Several houses had been altered; the heavy
sombre lattice work had given place, in many instances, to glass
windows and iron balconies. Some few families had arrived here
from Lisbon, and three from England; the ladies of the former had
shown the example of walking to mass in broad day-light; and those of
the latter were in the habit of going out to walk towards the close of
the day, for amusement. These improvements being once introduced
and practised by a few persons, were soon adopted by some, who had
been afraid to be the first, and by others who found that they were
pleasant. Formal silks and satins too were becoming a less usual
dress on high days and holidays, and were now much superseded by
white and coloured muslins, and other cotton manufactures. The
men, likewise, who had in former times daily appeared in full dress
suits of black, gold buckles, and cocked hats, had now, in many
instances, exchanged these for nankeen pantaloons, half boots, and
round hats. Even the high and heavy saddle was now less in use,
and that of more modern form was all the fashion. The sedan
chairs, in which the ladies often go to church, and to pay visits to
their friends, had now put on a much smarter appearance, and the
men who carried them were dressed more dashingly. These cannot
fail to attract the attention of strangers, in their gay cloaths, their
helmets and feathers, and their naked legs. The annexed print represents
one of these equipages.</p>

<p class="vh"><a name="i213" id="i213">i213</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<p>The country residences which had been lately built, were also
numerous; lands in the vicinity of Recife had risen in price; the
trade of brick-making was becoming lucrative; work-people were in
request; and besides many other spots of land, the track between the
villages of Poço da Panella and Monteiro, in extent about one mile,
which in 1810 was covered with brushwood, had now been cleared;
houses were building and gardens forming upon it. The great
church of Corpo Santo, situated in that part of the town which is
properly called Recife, was now finished, and various improvements
were meditated<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>. The time of advancement was come, and men,
who had for many years gone on without making any change either
in the interior or exterior of their houses, were now painting and
glazing on the outside, and new furnishing within; modernizing
themselves, their families, and their dwellings.</p>

<p>This spirit of alteration produced, in one case, rather ludicrous consequences.
There was a lady of considerable dimensions, who had
entered into this love of innovation, and carried it to a vast extent.
She was almost equal in circumference and height, but notwithstanding
this unfortunate circumstance, personal embellishments were not
to be despised; she wished to dress in English fashion, and was
herself decidedly of opinion that she had succeeded. Upon her
head she wore a very small gypsey hat tied under the chin. Stays
have only lately been introduced, but this improvement she had not
yet adopted; still her gown was to be in English fashion too, and
therefore was cut and slashed away, so as to leave most unmercifully
in view several beauties which otherwise would have remained concealed.
This gown was of muslin, and was worked down the middle
and round the bottom in several colours; her shoes were as small as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
could be allowed; but the unfortunate redundance of size also reached
the ankles and the feet, and thus rendering compression necessary;
the superabundance which nature had lavishly bestowed, projected
and hung down over each side of the shoes.</p>

<p>I became acquainted and somewhat intimate with the <i>Capitam-mor</i>
of a neighbouring district, from frequently meeting him, in my
evening visits to a Brazilian family. He was about to make the circuit
of his district in the course of a few weeks, and invited one of
my friends and myself to accompany him in this review or visit to
his officers, to which we readily agreed. It was arranged that he
should make us acquainted in due time with the day which he might
appoint for setting out, that we might meet him at his sugar-plantation,
from whence we were to proceed with him and his suite further
into the country.</p>

<p>The <i>Capitaens-mores</i>, captains-major, are officers of considerable
power. They have civil as well as military duties to perform, and
ought to be appointed from among the planters of most wealth and
individual weight in the several <i>Termos</i>, boundaries or districts; but
the interest of family or of relations about the Court, have occasioned
deviations from this rule; and persons very unfit for these situations,
have been sometimes nominated to them. The whole aspect of the
government in Brazil is military. All men between the ages of
sixteen and sixty, must be enrolled either as soldiers of the line, as
militia-men, or as belonging to the body of <i>Ordenanças</i>. Of the
regular soldiers, I have already spoken in another place. Of
the second class, each township has a regiment, of which the individuals,
with the exception of the major and adjutant, and in some
cases the colonel, do not receive any pay. But they are considered
as embodied men, and as such are called out upon some few occasions,
in the course of the year, to assemble in uniform, and otherwise
accoutred. The expense which must be incurred in this respect, of
necessity, precludes the possibility of many persons becoming
members of this class, even if the Government was desirous of increasing
the number of militia regiments. The soldiers of these are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
subject to their captains, to the colonel, and to the governor of the
province. The colonels are either rich planters, or the major or
lieutenant-colonel of a regiment of the line is thus promoted to the
command of one of these; in this case, and in this case only, he
receives pay. I am inclined to think that he ought to possess
some property in the district, and that any deviation from this rule is
an abuse; but I am not certain that the law so ordains. The majors
and the adjutants are likewise occasionally promoted from the line;
but whether they are regularly military men or planters, they receive
pay, as their trouble in distributing orders, and in other arrangements
connected with the regiment is considerable.</p>

<p>The third class, that of the <i>Ordenanças</i>, consisting of by far the largest
portion of the white persons and of free mulatto men of all shades,
have for their immediate chiefs the <i>Capitaens-mores</i>, who serve
without pay, and all the persons who are connected with the <i>Ordenanças</i>,
are obliged likewise to afford their services gratuitously.
Each district contains one <i>Capitam-mor</i>, who is invariably a person
possessing property in the part of the country to which he is appointed.
He is assisted by a major, captains, and <i>alferes</i>, who are
lieutenants or ensigns, and by sergeants and corporals. The duties
of the <i>Capitam-mor</i> are to see that every individual under his command
has in his possession some species of arms; either a firelock, a
sword, or a pike. He distributes the governor’s orders through his
district, and can oblige any of his men to take these orders to the
nearest captain, who sends another peasant forwards to the next
captain, and so forth, all which is done without any pay. A <i>Capitam-mor</i>
can also imprison for twenty-four hours, and send under arrest
for trial a person who is accused of having committed any crime, to the
civil magistrate of the town to which his district is immediately attached.
Now, the abuses of this office of <i>Capitam-mor</i> are very many, and
the lower orders of free persons are much oppressed by these great
men, and by their subalterns, down to the corporals. The peasants
are often sent upon errands which have no relation to public business;
for leagues and leagues these poor fellows are made to travel, for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
purpose of carrying some private letter of the chief, of his captains,
or of his lieutenants, without any remuneration. Indeed, many of
these men in place, seldom think of employing their slaves on these
occasions, or of paying the free persons so employed. This I have
witnessed times out of number; and have heard the peasants in all
parts of the country complain: it is a most heavy grievance.
Nothing so much vexes a peasant as the consciousness of losing his
time and trouble in a service which is not required by his Sovereign.
Persons are sometimes confined in the stocks for days together, on
some trifling plea, and are at last released without being sent to the
civil magistrate, or even admitted to a hearing. However,
I am happy to say, that I am acquainted with some men, whose conduct
is widely different from what I have above stated; but the
power given to an individual is too great, and the probability of being
called to an account for its abuse too remote, to insure the exercise of
it in a proper manner.</p>

<p>The free mulattos and free negroes whose names are upon the
rolls, either of the militia regiments which are commanded by white
officers, or by those of their own class and colour, are not, properly
speaking, subject to the <i>Capitaens-mores</i>. These officers and the
colonels of militia are appointed by the supreme government, and the
subaltern officers are nominated by the governor of each province.</p>

<p>The above explanation of the state of internal government I
thought necessary, that the reader might understand the grounds
upon which I was about to undertake the journey, of which some
account will immediately be given.</p>

<p>On the 28th January, 1812, the <i>Capitam-mor</i> sent one of his
servants to summon us to his plantation, and to be our guide. Early
on the morning following, my friend, myself, our own two servants,
and the boy who had been sent to us by the <i>Capitam-mor</i>, set forth
on horseback in high spirits; my friend and I expecting to see something
new and strange. I had before, as has been already related,
travelled into the less populous parts of the country; but I had had
very little communication with the planters. On that occasion, I proceeded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
too rapidly to obtain as much knowledge of their manners and
customs as I wished.</p>

<p>We proceeded to Olinda, and passed through its wretchedly paved
streets, with much care; and when we were descending the hill, upon
which it stands on the land side, there was laid open to us a considerable
extent of marshy ground, which was partly covered with
mandioc, planted upon raised beds or hillocks, which were made of a
circular form, that the water might not reach the roots of the plants;
the remainder of the land was still undrained and unproductive.
The darkness of the green of the plants which grow upon marshy
ground immediately points out the lands that are in this state. The
country which was to be seen in the distance was covered with wood.
We crossed a rivulet, communicating with the marshy land on
each side of the road, and passed on over some rising ground, and
by several scattered cottages, until we reached, distant from Olinda
one league, the low lands surrounding the hill which forms the site
of the sugar plantation of Fragozo. From hence the lands are low
and damp, almost without any rising ground, to the sugar plantation
of Paulistas. The beautiful spots upon this track of country are
numerous; cottages are oftentimes to be met with, half concealed
among the trees and brushwood; they are built of mud, and are
covered with the leaves of coco-trees. They have usually a projecting
pent-house with a small area in front, which is clear of weeds;
under this pent-house is slung the hammock, with its dark-coloured
owner, idly swinging backwards and forwards, who raises his head as
he hears the horses’ footsteps; the dog is basking in the sun, or lying
under the shade, or running out to annoy the traveller; and the
fishing baskets and the gourds hang as chance directs upon the protruding
stems of the coco-leaves, which cover the lowly hut. Some
times the sight of these rude dwellings is enlivened by the figure of a
female, who runs off, and conceals herself, as the passenger upon the
road looks down the narrow path which leads to the cottage. The
road itself was likewise narrow, (for this was not the great cattle
track) and all view of the country was generally shut out, by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
wood on each side, against which the legs of the horseman are often
brushing, and into which he is obliged to force his horse, if he should
chance to meet a carrier, with his panniers or his cotton bags on
either side of his beast, or one of the carts which are employed upon
the plantations. The print represents one of the cotton-carriers. In
the fore ground is described the species of palm tree called Tucum<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>,
and immediately behind it is the Mamoeiro, which produces its fruit
upon the stem; the fruit is large, and the pulp of it is soft, having much
resemblance in consistence and in taste to a melon that is too ripe;
the appearance of the fruit has some similarity likewise to a small
round melon.</p>

<p>To those who are unaccustomed to a country that is literally
covered with woods, which prevent an extensive view of the surrounding
objects, and the free circulation of air, the delightful sensations
which are produced by a fine green field, opening all at once
to the sight, and swept by a refreshing breeze, cannot possibly be felt.
The plantation of Paulistas is so situated. The buildings were
numerous, but most of them were low, and somewhat out of repair.
These are the dwelling-house of the owner, which is spacious, and has
one story above the ground floor; the chapel, with its large wooden
cross erected upon the centre of the gable end; the mill, a square
building without walls, its roof being supported upon brick pillars;
the long row of negro huts, the steward’s residence, and several
others of minor importance. These edifices are all of them scattered
upon a large field, which is occupied by a considerable number of
tame cattle; this is skirted by a dike which runs in front, but somewhat
at a distance from the dwelling-house of the owner, and through
it runs the water which turns the mill. On the opposite side of the
field is the chaplain’s cottage, with its adjoining lesser row of negro
huts, its plantain garden, and its wide spreading mango trees behind
it. Beyond the principal house, are low and extensive cane and
meadow lands, which are skirted on one side by the buildings of
another small plantation, and bordered at a great distance by woods,
which are situated upon the sides and summit of rising ground.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>This valuable and beautiful plantation was in the possession of a
near relation of our <i>Capitam-mor</i>. We were acquainted with the
son of the owner, who was chaplain to the estate, and had invited us
to make his residence our resting-place; this we did. He was prepared
to receive us, and after having breakfasted, we proceeded to
pay a visit to the old gentleman at the Great House, as the dwellings
of the owners of plantations are called. He was unwell, and could
not be seen; but we were received by his wife and two daughters.
They made many enquiries about England, and conversed upon other
subjects which they supposed we might be acquainted with. This
estate was not much worked; the slaves led a most easy life, and the
Great House was full of young children. Of these urchins several
came in and out of the room, they were quite naked, and played with
each other, and with some large dogs which were lying at full length
upon the floor. These ebony cupids were plainly great favourites,
and seemed to employ the greater part of the thoughts of the good
ladies, the youngest of whom was on the wrong side of fifty; and even
the priest laughed at their gambols. These excellent women and
the good priest possess a considerable number of slaves, who are
their exclusive property. It is their intention eventually to emancipate
all of them, and that they may be prepared for the change,
several of the men have been brought up as mechanics of different
descriptions; and the women have been taught needle-work, embroidery,
and all branches of culinary knowledge. Thus, by the
death of four individuals, who are now approaching to old age, will
be set free about sixty persons, men, women, and children. As these
people have been made acquainted with the intentions of their
owners respecting them, it is not surprising that the behaviour
of many of them should be overbearing. To some, the deeds of
manumission have been already passed conditionally, obliging them
to serve as slaves until the death of the individual to whom they are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
subject. These papers cannot be revoked, and yet no ingratitude was
feared; but among so considerable a number of persons, some instances
of it cannot, I fear, fail to be experienced. The owners said that all
their own immediate relations are rich, and not at all in need of
assistance; and that therefore independent of other reasons connected
generally with the system of slavery, these their children had
no right to work for any one else. Of the slaves in question, only a
few are Africans, the major part being mulattos and creole negroes.</p>

<p>We returned to the cottage of the priest to dinner, and in the
afternoon proceeded to the sugar plantation of Aguiar, belonging to
the <i>Capitam-mor</i>, which is distant from Paulistas five leagues, where
we arrived about ten o’clock at night, much fatigued. Immediately
beyond Paulistas is the narrow but rapid stream of Paratibi, which
near to its mouth changes this name for that of Doce. In the rainy
season it overflows its banks, and becomes unfordable. The width of
it, when it is in the usual state, near to Paulistas, is not above twenty
yards. In its course to the sea, it runs through much marshy ground.
We passed by four sugar-mills this afternoon; that which bears the
name of Utringa <i>de baixo</i>, is situated in an amphitheatre, being surrounded
by high hills, covered with large trees. These woods have
not been much disturbed, and therefore give refuge to enormous
quantities of game, among which the <i>porco do mato</i>, or pig of the
woods, is common. I never saw this animal, and therefore cannot
pretend to describe it; but I have often heard it spoken of, as being
extremely destructive to mandioc, and that its flesh is good. This
animal is not large, and is not unlike the common hog<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>. Many criminals<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
and runaway negroes are harboured in these woods. The
inhabitants of Utinga seem to be shut out from all the rest of the
world, as the path which leads from it is not immediately distinguished.
The last three leagues, which we traversed in the dark,
were covered with almost unbroken woods; the path through them
is narrow, and the branches of the trees cross it in all directions;
our guide rode in front, and many times did his head come in contact
with them.</p>

<p>The dwelling of the <i>Capitam-mor</i> is a large building of one story
above the ground floor: the lower part of which forms the warehouse
for the sugar and other articles which the estate produces. We
ascended a wooden staircase, erected on the outside of the building,
entered a small anti-chamber, and were received by our host and one
of his sons, who conducted us into a spacious apartment beyond.
A long table, and one of rather less dimensions, a couple of benches,
and a few broken and unpainted chairs formed the whole furniture of
these rooms. Four or five black boys, who were of a size too far advanced
to wear the bow and arrow, but who were quite as little encumbered
with dress as if they still might wield these dangerous
weapons in the character of cupids, stood all astonishment to view
the strange beings that had just arrived; and at all the doors were
women’s heads peeping to see whom we might be. The supper consisted
as is usual of great quantities of meat, placed upon the table
without arrangement.</p>

<p>At five o’clock in the morning, the <i>capitam-mor</i>, my friend, myself,
and three servants proceeded to the distance of three leagues without
any addition to our party; but we were soon joined by the adjutant
of the district and several other officers, in uniforms of dark blue
with yellow facings most monstrously broad&mdash;the gay cuffs reaching
half way up to the elbows; they wore round hats with short feathers,
straight swords of most prodigious length, and very loose nankeen
pantaloons and boots; the former were thrust within the latter, which
caused the higher part of the pantaloons to appear to be of preposterous
width. We dismounted at a sugar plantation, being the third we had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
passed through this morning; here we were invited to stay to breakfast,
but this we could not do, and were therefore regaled with pine-apples
and oranges. The owner of this place had taken great pains
with his garden, and had reared several fruits which require much
care; but it is strange that, although there are many which may be
raised with very little trouble, still upon far the greater number
of plantations even oranges are not to be found. The ant is, I well
know, a great persecutor of this tree, but when care is taken in this
respect, and a little water is afforded during the dry months for two
or three years, none else is necessary. Upon the same plantation
have been practised the most monstrous cruelties; the conduct of
the owner towards his slaves is often spoken of with abhorrence,
but yet he is visited and treated with the same respect which is paid
to an individual of unblemished character. It is however almost the
only instance of which I heard of systematic, continued, wanton
enormity; but it has here occurred and has passed unpunished, and
this one is sufficient, even if none other existed, to stamp the slave
system as an abomination which ought to be rooted out. The estate
was inherited by the person in question, with sixty good slaves upon
it; fifteen years have elapsed since that time to the period of which I
speak, and there were then remaining only four or five individuals
who were able to work. Some have fled and have escaped, others
have died, God knows how, and others again have committed suicide
in sight of their master’s residence.</p>

<p>We arrived at mid-day at Santa Cruz, and had now reached the
cotton country. The track through which we had passed was for
the most part well watered and well wooded; the marshy lands being
less frequently interspersed than upon the journey of the preceding
day. The sugar plantations were numerous; we saw eight of them
this morning. The ground was often uneven, and we crossed one
rather steep hill. The lands upon which we had now arrived and
those to which we were advancing are altogether higher, and the grass
upon them was now much burnt up, the “first waters” not having
yet fallen. The soil in these parts retains less moisture than that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
of the country which we had left, and soon becomes too hard to be
worked. The party was now much increased, and in the afternoon
we proceeded to Pindoba, a cotton plantation of considerable extent;
the owner of it is wealthy and possesses many slaves. He received
us in his dressing-gown, under which he wore a shirt, drawers, and a
pair of stockings. After the first greetings were over, he brought out
a small bottle of liqueur made in the country, to which he himself
helped his guests, one solitary glass, which was filled, and then emptied
by each person, being made use of by the whole party. After
supper a guitar player belonging to the house entertained us until a
late hour, whilst our host sat upon a table smoking from a pipe of
fully six feet in length. Several hammocks were slung in two large
apartments, and each person either talked or went to sleep, or occasionally
did one and the other, no form or ceremony being observed.</p>

<p>The peasants began to assemble early on the following morning,
as three companies of the <i>Ordenanças</i> were to be reviewed. These
were the first which were to undergo inspection, as the <i>capitam-mor</i>
purposed visiting again the places through which we had passed on
his return, and intended then to perform this duty. The men wore
their usual dress of shirt and drawers, and perhaps a nankeen jacket
and pantaloons were added, and most of them had muskets. The
<i>capitam-mor</i> came forth this day in his scarlet uniform, and sat himself
down near to a table. The captain of the company which was
about to be reviewed stood near to him with the muster-roll. The
names of the privates were called over by the captain, and as each
name was repeated by the sergeant, who stood at the door-way, the
individual to whom it belonged came in and presented arms to the
<i>capitam-mor</i>, then turned about and retired. It was truly ridiculous,
but at the same time painful, to see the fright which the countenances
of some of the poor fellows expressed, and their excessive awkwardness
when they came to present themselves; whilst others displayed evident
self-sufficiency; these were well-dressed and performed every
manœuvre with as much neatness and promptitude as they were
capable of, expressive of superior knowledge and in hopes of admiration.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
There were of course many absentees, and for the non-appearance
of these some reason was given by one of the officers of the company
to which the man belonged, or by a neighbour. The excuses
were usually received as all-sufficient, without any further enquiry being
made. However the absence of one of the captains was not thus
quietly acquiesced in, and therefore an officer was dispatched to his
house to bring him to Pindoba under an arrest. Whether this proceeded
from some private pique, or from zeal for the public service,
I do not pretend to determine, but he soon arrived in custody. He
was put into one of the apartments of the house which we were
inhabiting, and a sergeant was stationed at the door as a sentinel.
The <i>capitam-mor</i> soon however relented, upon which he was released
and allowed to return home.</p>

<p>At dinner the great man took the head of the table, and the owner
of the house stood by and waited upon him. Every thing was served
up in enormous quantities, for the party was large and this is the
custom; there was no sort of regularity observed; every man helped
himself to the dish which pleased him best, and this was oftentimes
done, with the knife which the person had been making use of upon
his own plate, and by reaching across two or three of his neighbours
for the purpose. A nice bit was not safe even upon one’s own plate,
being occasionally snatched up, and another less dainty given in return.
Much wine was drank during dinner, and the glasses were
used in common. We soon rose from table, and the party, generally
speaking, took the accustomed <i>sesta</i> or nap after dinner which is
usual in warm climates. My friend and I walked out in the afternoon,
but there was nothing to tempt us to go far, for the neighbourhood
possessed no natural beauty and the dry weather had burnt up
the grass, and had made the face of the country extremely dreary.</p>

<p>Early on the morrow about forty persons sallied forth for the village
of Bom Jardim. It is distant from Pindoba one league and a
half. We arrived there at seven o’clock. This village is built in the
form of a square; the houses are low, but the church is large and
handsome. Like the huts of Açu and of some other places, those of
Bom Jardim are not white-washed, and therefore the mud of which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
they are composed remains in its original colour. The place contains
about 500 inhabitants. We ascended a steep hill to arrive at
it, and on the opposite side still another of equal height is to be surmounted
in proceeding farther inland. The village is situated upon
a break of the hill. The soil is chiefly composed of red earth, approaching
in places to a bright scarlet, with veins of yellow running
through it; this is the description of soil, which is said to be the best
adapted to the growth of cotton. Bom Jardim is a great rendezvous
for the hawkers who are proceeding to the Sertam, and for others
who merely advance thus far. It is distant from Recife twenty
good leagues, in a N. E. direction.</p>

<p>My friend and I walked out and descended the hill by a path
which led us to the bed of the river, for there was now no water in
it. Great want of water is often experienced at Bom Jardim, but I
think that if wells of sufficient depth were dug, a supply might be
obtained<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>. On our return to the village, we discovered that Mass
was about to be said, and therefore we accompanied some of our
party to the church. It was crowded; indeed it is a remark which I
was frequently led to make, that on Sundays and Holidays when the
peasantry assemble at the church doors, their numbers must astonish
those persons who merely pass through the country without opportunities
being afforded to them of a more minute examination. The cottages
upon the road side do not promise so numerous a population as
is on these occasions to be seen; but from the thickness of the woods
and the lowness of the huts, even when a view of the country is by
any accident to be obtained from a high hill, the dwellings of the
lower orders of people are not to be perceived; they are scattered all
over the country; and narrow paths which appear impassable or
nearly so, and are scarcely to be observed, often lead to four or
five huts, situated in the centre of a wood or upon some low ground,
adapted to the cultivation of mandioc and maize.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>One company was reviewed at Bom Jardim, and from hence a
captain was deputed to continue the review further into the country.
We rode this afternoon one league to the house of Captain
Anselmo, being so far upon our return. On our way to this place
we saw the woods on one side of the road on fire. In the dry season
the grass and brushwood become so completely parched, that the
least spark sets a whole track of country in a blaze. I mean that the
fire will sometimes run on for a league, and even more. It will occasionally
blaze forth most violently, and catching the branches of the
large trees, the flames will at intervals flash above their summit;&mdash;it
will then subside, but continue smothered in the hollow of some
aged tree, or in a heap of leaves which still retain some moisture;
but a breath of air spreads it abroad, and it again runs on with violence.
The peasants almost invariably smoke as they go along, and
oftentimes they ask for a lighted piece of wood at a cottage which
they may chance to pass. It is astonishing to see with what unconcern
they will hurl this from them still unextinguished, knowing, as
they do full well, the consequences which frequently have ensued.
The act of setting fire to a wood is subject to punishment by law,
if intention or even carelessness can be proved. The crop of canes
of some estates have, in many instances, been injured by these
means.</p>

<p>Captain Anselmo resides upon a cotton plantation which is his own
property, and is cultivated by about forty negroes. The house is situated
upon the shelf of a steep hill, with a beautiful plain below, upon
which trees are thickly scattered. At the foot of the hill is a large fishpond,
through which a rivulet runs in the rainy season. The owner
has lately inclosed a piece of land, and was making a garden upon
the borders of the pond. The dwelling-house was new and had a
second floor; it was very clean and well furnished. This was the
most pleasantly situated and the best arranged mansion which we
visited during this journey; the huts for the slaves were well built
and looked comfortable. Here we were entertained with such music
as has as yet found its way into these parts of the country. Three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
negroes with bagpipes attempted to play a few tunes whilst we were
at dinner, but they seemed to play in different keys from each other,
and sometimes each appeared to have struck up a tune of his own
composing. I think I never heard so bad an attempt at producing
harmonious sounds as the <i>charameleiros</i> made. The possession of
a band of these bespeaks a certain degree of superiority, consequently
the planters pride themselves upon their musicians.</p>

<p>Our party could not let pass this opportunity of being together
without practising the amusement of the <i>intrudo</i><a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>, although the usual
time of its celebration was yet distant one week. On the day subsequent
to that of our arrival, dinner was scarcely over before the
<i>farinha</i>, the bananas, the rice, and other dainties upon the table, were
hurled at each other’s heads; soon the smart uniform coats were
taken off, and in his shirt sleeves each man began this civil war with
heart and soul. Every thing was borne with perfect good humour,
and at last, fatigued and bedaubed, all of us retired to the hammocks
which had been provided for the party. But as our evil
stars would have it, a brave captain closed quietly all the shutters
(as the moon was shining very bright into the room) and then he
placed himself near to an enormous jar of water, which stood in one
corner of the apartment, and with a small pitcher in his hand soon
dealt around him its contents, awakening us with repeated showers,
and obliging us to take shelter under the chairs and tables. This,
and other jokes allied to it, continued until the break of day, when
we prepared for a continuation of our journey. One company was
reviewed here.</p>

<p>We proceeded to the house of Captain Paulo Travasso, distant one
league. As was our usual custom, my friend and I walked out soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
after our arrival, and in returning, instead of pursuing the path,
which was rather circuitous, we attempted to climb up a bank, that
we might the sooner reach the house; my friend was before me, and
as he scrambled up it, his foot slipped, which caused him to catch at
the stump of a small plant, that grew upon the side of the bank.
He gave up his idea of going by that way to the house, and returned
to me, bringing with him the plant, with its root and the earth about
it. On going to throw it away, he perceived upon his hand the glitter
of a substance which made us return to the spot. We gathered some
more of the earth, and this gentleman, who had long resided upon
the coast of Africa, judged the substance which was mixed with it to
be gold dust.</p>

<p>At this place the <i>intrudo</i> was continued more violently than before;
for even the blackened pots and pans from the kitchen were introduced
to besmear each other’s faces. We obtained here a view of
the females belonging to the house; but every where else, they had
been too rigorously guarded, or were naturally too reserved to enable
us to see them. Some excuse was made by the young men who
were acquainted with the family, to draw them into the sport; and
the ladies and their slaves were nothing loath to see and to participate
in what was going forwards. A circumstance occurred which
created much laughter, and which is but too characteristic. One man
whom we met at this place, had all along begged of those who were
engaged in the sport, that they would not wet him, because he was
unwell; however it was seen that he did not observe towards others
that forbearance which he entreated from them towards himself.
One of our party seeing this, attacked him with a large silver ladle
filled with water; the man ran out of the house, and the other followed;
but when they were at some distance from it, he turned upon
his pursuer, and drawing his knife, stood at some distance, threatening
to stab him if he advanced. The other, striking his left side at
the place in which knives are usually carried, likewise threatened
him, and without delay advanced towards him, having picked up a
thick stick as he approached. But his adversary did not like the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
thoughts of a close combat, and soon set off at full speed, with his
knife in his hand. In this manner, he entered the back door of the
house, whilst he of the silver ladle took the front door. They met
in the apartment from which they had started, when the latter
opened his waistcoat and shewed that he had not a knife; thus
proving before the whole party, that he of the knife had run away
from one who was unarmed. This was quite sufficient; the women
made a general attack upon him: he went to the stable, mounted his
horse, and set forth; but his misfortunes had not yet ended, for the
path by which he must retreat lay under two of the windows of
the house, and as he passed, two large tubs of water drenched him
and his steed, which immediately quickened its pace, amidst the
hooting of every one present.</p>

<p>We continued our journey in the afternoon to a sugar plantation,
the property of Captain Joam Soares, where we remained until the
following day. Some of us were tired of the <i>intrudo</i>, and therefore
sought shelter in the mill and adjoining out-houses, when we saw the
sport again commencing; but we were about to be attacked, when we
gained the roofs of one of the buildings, and from hence could not
be dislodged.</p>

<p>I had frequently seen the <i>saboeiro</i> or soap tree, which is to be
chiefly found in these districts. It is a large shrub, which puts forth
numerous branches in every direction, so that when it is in full leaf, it
has somewhat the appearance of trees that have been clipped, (as
was formerly practised in gardens,) which is increased by the leaves
being small and growing very close to each other. The receptacle
of the seed is about the size of a small plum; when this is put into
water, and rubbed with some violence, it produces the same effect as
that which is caused by soap in water, and it has the same property
of cleansing<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>. The <i>pao do alho</i> or garlic tree, is to be met with in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
great abundance in these districts. The name is derived from the
similitude of the smell of the leaves and the wood of this plant to
garlic. The tree abounds so greatly, and, I suppose, reminded the first
settlers so much of one of their favourite European culinary ingredients,
that it has given name to a town, and to a whole district.</p>

<p>About five o’clock in the afternoon we proceeded to Limoeiro, a
large and thriving village<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>. It is composed of one street of about
three quarters of a mile in length, which is closed at one end by the
church and vicarage: this building belonged formerly to the Jesuits.
The trade of Limoeiro with the interior is considerable, and particularly
on the day of the market, which is held weekly, the bustle is
excessive. These days seldom pass without some murders being
committed, or at least many wounds and blows being given; but the
markets of Nazareth or Lagoa d’Anta are those which are particularly
famed for the disturbances that usually take place there. These
became so considerable at one time, that the governor found it necessary
to issue orders for a patrole to keep the peace on market days.</p>

<p>Limoeiro contains about six hundred inhabitants, and is increasing
daily. It stands upon the banks of the river Capibaribe, which was
at this time quite dry. The distance from Recife is fourteen good
leagues. We were entertained by the vicar, who has taken very little
pains to have a decent residence, and cannot fail to be somewhat
indifferent about his own life, for every step to which we advanced
as we ascended to the apartments above, promised to be the last that
would hold us. The floors of the rooms into which we were ushered,
seemed to be laid out as traps to ensnare those who might not tread
cautiously; some of the boards were broken, and large holes remained;
others were loose, and it was dangerous to pass over them;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
and besides the several perils of this mansion, substances which are
not pleasant to the nose might unwarily be trampled upon. Never
did I see so miserable a dwelling, whose inhabitant might with so
much ease have bettered the state in which we found it. However,
I ought not to complain, for to counterbalance all this, we had a teapot,
sugar basin, and other parts of the equipage of silver.</p>

<p>The <i>Capitam-mor</i> had still several posts to visit, which would delay
him for a considerable time; therefore as my friend was anxious to
return to Recife, we left our party, with much regret, and were accompanied
in the morning by the adjutant, who was about to return
home. I had been greatly amused, and wished to have seen the
conclusion of the affair. At Limoeiro, several companies were to be
reviewed, and from thence the <i>Capitam-mor</i> proceeded to Pao do
Alho<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> and Nazareth, or Lagoa d’Anta<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>, two large villages of considerable
importance. Both of them are within a few leagues of the
place from which we separated from our companions. We returned
to Santa Cruz, passed through that village, and were entertained at
the house of the adjutant. We reached Aguiar in the afternoon,
being received at that place by one of the <i>Capitam-mor</i>’s sons, a
young man of eighteen years of age; and we also saw the <i>Capitam-mor</i>’s
interesting wife, who is likewise his niece; she was about fifteen
years of age, he being about forty-six. We slept there, and stopped
at Paulistas on the following day at noon, from whence we proceeded
to Recife on the evening of the 6th February.</p>

<p>I heard one of the sugar planters bitterly complaining of his
poverty, and that his want of hands to work his mill obliged him to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
give up the cultivation of much of the best land of his estate. Soon
after he had uttered these complaints, the conversation turned upon
saddle-horses and their trappings; and he then told us that he had
lately purchased a new saddle and bridle, which he wished us to see.
These new trappings were most superb affairs; the saddle was made
of morocco leather and green velvet, and silver headed nails and plates
of the same metal were profusely scattered and placed upon all parts
of this and of the bridle. He told us that the whole had cost him
four hundred <i>mil reis</i>, about 110<i>l.</i> This sum of money would have
purchased four slaves. But the matter did not end here, for he opened
a drawer in which were strewed several broken silver spoons, spurs,
&amp;c. and he said that he was collecting a sufficient quantity of this
metal for the purpose of having his groom’s horse ornamented in
the same manner as his own.</p>

<p>The free persons of colour who inhabit the track of country through
which we passed are more numerous than I had previously imagined.
The companies of Ordenanças vary much in strength; some consist
of one hundred and fifty men and more, and others of not above fifty.
The peasantry of the <i>Mata</i>, that is, of the country which lies between
the plentiful well-watered districts of the coast and the Sertoens, have
not a general good character. The miserable life which they, oftener
than others, are obliged to lead from the want of water and of provisions,
seems to have an unfavourable effect upon them; they are
represented as being more vindictive and more quarrelsome, and less
hospitable than their neighbours. To say that a man is a <i>matuto da
mata</i>, a woodman of the wood, is no recommendation to him.</p>

<p>During this journey I heard the following story; and as I was acquainted
with the person to whom the circumstances occurred, I can
vouch for its veracity. A Brazilian who had been wealthy, but who
had, through many imprudencies, and from many deeds which
deserve a much severer name, reduced himself to a state of comparative
poverty, resided in this part of the country at the time I travelled
through it. He was a man of loose morals and savage disposition,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
but of most pleasant manners. He had in one particular
instance, which pre-eminently stamped his character, behaved in a
most shameful manner to a lady to whom he professed himself to be
attached. He had possessed many slaves; but at the time the following
occurrences took place three or four only remained, and of these
one alone was in health. Apprehensive of being assassinated by
some of the persons whom he had injured and insulted, he usually
kept the doors and windows of his residence well secured, excepting
one entrance which was likewise closed at dusk. One evening, three
men knocked at the door, and asked leave to pass the night in some
of the out-houses of the plantation; the owner answered from
within, but did not open the door, saying that they might sleep in the
mill. About an hour afterwards there was another knock, and a
person requested that some fruit might be sold to him. The owner
fetched some, and inconsiderately opened the door to give it to the
man; but when he looked out, all the three were there, and as he
reached the fruit to one of them, a second fired, and the greatest part
of the shot entered the abdomen. The known courage of the
wounded man made these fellows hesitate in approaching him immediately,
by which means he had time to reach his sword, which
stood near to where he was, and he was enabled to close and bolt
the door. This being done, he reached his bed with great difficulty,
expecting that every minute would be his last. The men tried
to gain admittance through some of the doors or windows; but
not succeeding in this, they rode off. As soon as the slave who
was in health heard the report of the gun, and saw his master
wounded, he left the house, recollecting (which is somewhat surprising)
to lock the door; he made all haste to a neighbouring
plantation, distant one league. The owner of the place to which
the slave had fled, ordered a hammock to be prepared, and set off
with sixteen negroes; he was accompanied by his chaplain, who
brought with him a candle, and all the other necessary appendages to
the bed-side of a dying Catholic. They arrived, and found the
wounded man in a state which led them to suppose that he could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
not live many hours; but he was confessed, and anointed with
the holy oil, and thus prepared for the worst. Then they put him
into the hammock, and his neighbour had him conveyed to his
residence. The person who related this story to me, did not fail
to add, that a lighted candle was carried in a lantern, that the
wounded man should not run the risk of dying without having the
light in his hand, as is the custom. A surgeon was sent for to
Iguaraçu, which is distant several leagues, and he succeeded in extracting
almost all the shot. Notwithstanding the delay, and other
unfavourable circumstances, I saw this man in good health in 1813.
Whilst he still remained in a dangerous state at the house of his
friend, a Sertanejo Indian, well armed, passed through the place, and
asked one of the negroes if he was still alive. It was generally
said that he must remove to some far distant part of the country,
otherwise he might daily expect another attack, and particularly as
his enemies were Sertanejos. The men who had attempted to
murder him were dressed after the manner of these people, and
were seen on the following day travelling towards the interior.
They mentioned at some of the cottages at which they stopped, that
they believed they had prevented one man from eating any more <i>piram</i>,
which is equal to an European using in the same manner the word
bread. The person whom they had attacked could not be sure of
the quarter from whence the blow proceeded; for many were those
from which he might have expected it. In Brazil, injured persons
or their relatives must either allow their own wrongs and those of
their families to go unpunished, or they must themselves undertake
the chastisement of him who has committed the crime. The evil
proceeds, immediately, from the vastness of the country, and from the
want of attention in the government to counteract this disadvantage.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XI.</h2>

<p class="pch">RESIDENCE AT JAGUARIBE.&mdash;JOURNEY TO GOIANA.&mdash;ILLNESS.&mdash;RETURN
TO JAGUARIBE.</p>


<p class="drop-cap13">AFTER the journey to Bom Jardim, I did not again leave Recife
for any length of time, until I entered with a friend into a
scheme of farming. It had been greatly my wish to remove from the
town into the country, from preference, rather than from any
other cause.</p>

<p>In the beginning of April, 1812, we rented the sugar-plantation
of Jaguaribe, distant from Recife four leagues, in a northward direction,
and about one league from the coast; it had upon it several
slaves, oxen, machinery, and implements, which enabled the new
tenant to enter it immediately. A few days after these matters were
arranged, I accompanied the owner to the plantation for the purpose
of meeting the person who was about to leave it, being the second
visit which I had made to my intended place of residence. Having
agreed with this man, the owner and myself returned to sleep at the
dwelling of one of his brothers, which was situated about a mile
and a half from the coast; this person had purchased some lands, which
he was now clearing, and upon which he was erecting several buildings.
He and his family inhabited a barn, and we were to sleep in
his new house, of which the roof and the wood-work of the walls
were alone erected. The rainy season had commenced, and this
unfinished dwelling was almost surrounded by pools of stagnant
water, inhabited by enormous toads, whose loud and hoarse croaking
continued during the whole of the night, without intermission. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
trunks of the trees which had been cut down a short time before,
were lying as they had fallen in all directions. In the morning I set
off alone, on my return to Recife; I made for the sea-shore, and soon
reached the river Doce, a narrow stream, which after a course of four
or five leagues here discharges its waters into the sea. The tide
enters it, and again recedes with considerable rapidity; at such times
it is not fordable, but at the ebb the remaining waters are very trifling,
and some parts of the channel are left quite dry. It is necessary to
pass quickly over, as the sand of which its bed is composed is very
fine, and although not altogether what is called quicksand, still to
delay in one spot is not quite safe. When the tide is out the water
of the river is quite sweet, which has obtained for it the name of
Doce.</p>

<p>It was upon the borders of this river that the Portugueze and
the Dutch were first opposed to each other in that part of Brazil<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>;
here commenced that memorable struggle upon which the Pernambucans,
with so much reason, pride themselves. The beginning was
not propitious, and did not augur well of the result, but time
proved the people to be worthy of the beautiful country which they
inhabit. The river Tapado, upon the banks of which the Portugueze
commander afterwards attempted to rally his men<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>, lies between
the Doce and Olinda. It is a rivulet or dyke (for it resembles
more the latter than the former) without any outlet to the sea, but
it is only separated from it by the sands, which are here about twenty
yards across. When the rains have been violent the additional
waters of the Tapado are discharged over the sands, and sometimes
at spring tides, when the wind blows fresh, a few waves will reach
over them and fall into the dyke; this being the only manner in
which they can communicate with each other. At the Doce likewise
landed Pedro Jaques de Magalhaens, the general, and Brito
Freire (now known as an historian), the admiral of the fleet which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
assisted the patriots of Pernambuco in the completion of their long-desired
and hardly-earned object,&mdash;the re-conquest of Recife and
consequent expulsion of the Dutch.<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p>

<p>But to return,&mdash;I arrived upon the banks of the Doce, and asked
at a cottage, which was not far distant, if the river was fordable, and
being answered in the affirmative, I rode up to its banks and
attempted to make my horse enter it, which he refused to do. I
made a second and a third trial, when he plunged in swimming; it
was with much difficulty that he gained the outermost point of the
sand-bank on the opposite side. He had passed a bad night and
was not in a proper state to perform this task, nor should I have attempted
it if I had known the depth, but I imagined that the
tide had sufficiently retreated. My clothes were dry before I arrived
at home, but I long felt the consequences of crossing the Doce.</p>

<p>About the middle of May I removed to Jaguaribe. The road to it
is through the plantation of Paulistas, from whence, after crossing the
Paratibi, a narrow path leads to the left through a deep wood for
nearly one league. A steep hill is to be surmounted, and its corresponding
declivity carefully descended. The wood continues to a
break in the hill, on the side nearest to Jaguaribe. On reaching
this spot there was a view before me, which would in most situations
be accounted very beautiful, but in this delightful country
so many fine prospects are continually presenting themselves, that I
opened upon this with few feelings of pleasure at the sight. I cannot
avoid owning that the advantages of the place as a plantation
occupied my mind more deeply than its beauties. Immediately before
me was a cottage and a row of negro huts, surrounded by
banana-trees, standing upon a shelf of the hill. Beyond these to
the left was the narrow, but far-extending valley, upon whose nearest
border were situated the buildings of Jaguaribe upon an open field,
with the hills behind, and in front was the rivulet. To the right was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
a deep dell, with an expanse of country not thickly covered with
wood; and rather in advance, but also to the right, were numerous
deep-coloured mangroves, which pointed out that a stream of considerable
size ran down among them. On the other side of the
nearest of these mangroves, and yet not very far, was the high peak
of St. Bento, with the mandioc, and maize lands, and wood upon its
side, and the path winding up through them, which is at times concealed,
and at times in view;&mdash;but the buildings are not to be seen,
though the tolling of the chapel-bell may be often heard, from the
spot upon which I was standing.</p>

<p>I was under the necessity of taking up my abode in the vestry of
the chapel, as the Great House was still occupied. The negroes were
already at work for us, and under the direction of a proper <i>feitor</i> or
manager. The whole neighbourhood was astonished at the place I
had determined to inhabit, until some other dwelling presented itself.
I was certainly not comfortably situated, for the vestry consisted
of only one apartment, with a door-way to the field and
another into the church, the latter being without a door; the
church was unfinished, and was the resort of bats and owls; however
it was principally my unconcern respecting ghosts which my neighbours
were surprised at. A negro boy and myself remained at night
to encounter these, if any should appear, and to receive our constant
visitors the bats. My companion rolled himself up upon the ground
in a piece of baize and a mat, and thus cased, was quite safe. I
slept in a hammock, and oftentimes these unwelcome guests alighted
upon it, as if they had come for the chance of a toe or a finger
making its appearance, upon which they might fix. This way of living
did not last long, nor did I wish that it should.</p>

<p>The house of which I have spoken as being situated upon a shelf
of the hill, and as looking down upon the valley, was soon without
an inhabitant, and therefore to this I removed. It was large, but
the floors of the rooms were without bricks, and the interior walls
had not been white-washed for ages, and some of them had never
undergone the operation. I received visits and presents, as is customary,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
from my immediate neighbours,&mdash;the white persons and
those of colour who aspire to gentility; and indeed many individuals
of the lower class did not neglect to come and offer their services to
the new-comer, whose character and disposition towards them, they
judged that it was necessary to become acquainted with. In many
instances, the wives of the latter description of visitors came also and
brought sweetmeats, fruit, or flowers. I received them all, sitting in
my hammock; the men sat round on chairs, but the women generally
squatted down upon the floor, though it was formed of earth. I talked
to them of my intentions, and of my wish to conciliate, and I heard
much of bickerings and squabbles among those of their own rank,
and of feuds between their superiors, the same stories being related
to me in many different ways. They were much surprised that I
should wear so much cloaths, saying, that I ought to do as they did
and be unencumbered; and their advice I soon followed. I was
much amused, and for some days these visits took up the largest
portion of my time.</p>

<p>The lands around me to the North, belonged to the Benedictine
friars; and to the East to an old lady; those of the latter were much
neglected, but those which were possessed by the former were in high
order. To the South, beyond the wood through which I passed in
coming to Jaguaribe, are the lands of Paulistas; and to the West
and North West are some excellent cane lands, belonging to a religious
lay brotherhood of free negroes of Olinda, which were tenanted
by and subdivided among a great number of persons of low rank,
whites, mulattos, and blacks.</p>

<p>The work went on regularly, and I had soon very little in which to
employ my time, excepting in those things by which I might think
proper to amuse myself.</p>

<p>In the beginning of June, it was necessary that I should visit
Goiana; however I took a circuitous route for the purpose of seeing
something new. I was accompanied by an old free man of colour and
by Manoel, a faithful African. We slept the first night at Aguiar, the
estate of the <i>capitam-mor</i> with whom I had travelled to Bom Jardim; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
on the following morning proceeded through several sugar plantations.
We rested at mid-day at Purgatorio, a small cotton and mandioc
plantation, but we could not purchase any thing of which to make a
dinner, and therefore, as was usual on such occasions, we smoked in
place of eating. When the sun had declined a little we again set
forth. A few of the sugar plantations through which we passed in
the afternoon were in a decayed state. We stopped at a cottage, and
begged the owner to sell us a fowl but she refused;&mdash;we had not
eaten any thing this day. I was loath so to do, but I could not avoid
saying that she <i>must</i> sell one, that I did not mind the price, but that
hunger would not allow me to let her do as she pleased in this case.
She fixed upon one, and made me pay exorbitantly for it. We
parted in the end very good friends; she offered me some herbs with
which to cook the bird, and after this reconciliation we again advanced.
By going to Purgatorio we had left the usual direct road&mdash;cross
roads even in England are not good, so what must they be in
Brazil? In one part we were obliged to lean down upon our horses’
necks, and to proceed in this manner for some distance, with the
branches of the trees completely closed above. The plantation of
Mundo Novo, or the new world, which we reached late in the afternoon,
was in ruins; trees grew in the chapel, and the brushwood in
front of the dwelling-house rose higher than its roof. I slept at a
cottage hard by, which was inhabited by an elderly man and a number
of children, large and small. The ill-fated fowl, and another
which we had also obtained by the way, were dressed by the daughters
of our host. Soon the cooking was effected, and I commenced
operations, literally with tooth and nail, upon one of the birds, for
there were no knives, forks, or spoons to be had; however I did receive
some assistance from my own <i>faca de ponta</i>, a pointed knife or
dirk, which, though prohibited by law, is worn by all ranks of persons.
At night, my hammock was slung under the pent-house; at a late
hour a shower of rain came on; our host had a vast herd of goats;
these crowded in from the rain, and soon I was obliged, in self-defence,
to rise, as I discovered that they had very little respect for me;&mdash;my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
head and some of their’s having come in contact, made me look out
for better quarters; and these I found upon a high table, where I
remained until the visitors again ventured forth. We proceeded on
the morrow, and reached Goiana by the low marshy lands of Catû.
The river was scarcely fordable; but we crossed, and on the opposite
side the loose mud in the road reached above the horses’ knees and
continued along it for more than one hundred yards; we entered it,
and the horses gently waded through; but mine unfortunately felt
that his tail was not quite easy in the mud, and therefore began to
move it to and fro on either side; and as it was long, (much too long
on this occasion) it struck me at every jerk. My dress was a light-coloured
nankeen jacket and trowsers, and I came forth, without
exaggeration, one cake of mud from head to foot.</p>

<p>I rode to the residence of a person with whom I had been long
acquainted; he had taken up his quarters at a new mandioc
plantation which had been lately established in the outskirts of
Goiana; my friend had removed to this place to superintend some of
the workmen. I stayed only two days at Goiana, for I soon accomplished
the object of my journey, which was to obtain twenty Indian
labourers from Alhandra. My return to Jaguaribe was by the usual
road.</p>

<p>The day after my arrival at my new home, I rode to Recife, and
had on the following day an attack of ague. I had exposed myself
lately too much to the sun, and had been several times wet through.
The disorder left me in a fortnight; my horses were sent for,&mdash;they
came, and I set off for Jaguaribe; but in mid-way, I was drenched
with rain, and reaching that place much tired, went to sleep unintentionally
in my hammock, without changing my cloaths. In the
morning I felt that the ague was returning, and therefore ordered
my horse and rode out to try to shake off the attack, which the
peasants say it is possible to do. However, whilst I was talking
with a neighbour, on horseback at his door, the ague came on, and I
was unable to return to my own dwelling.</p>

<p>The next day the Indians from Alhandra arrived; they had imbibed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
strange notions of the riches of an Englishman; and their captain
told me, that they knew I was very rich, and could afford to give
higher wages than any one else. I tried to undeceive them in this
respect, but all to no purpose. I offered the usual rate of labour in
the country; but their characteristic obstinacy had entered into
them, and they preferred returning as they came to any abatement of
their first demand; although this was 25 <i>per cent.</i> higher than any
person had ever been known to give for daily labour. They dined,
placed their wallets upon their shoulders, and went their way. One
of my people said, as they disappeared, ascending the hill, beyond
the field, “They had rather work for any one else for half the
money, than lower in their demands to you.”</p>

<p>I was removed from this neighbour’s house, after a few days, in
a hammock; but finding that the disorder increased, I sent for the
manager, an old man of colour, whose wife attended upon me. By
my desire, he collected a sufficient number of bearers, as it was my
wish to be carried to Recife. About five o’clock in the afternoon
we set off; there were sixteen men to bear the hammock by turns,
and the manager was likewise in company; of these persons only two
were slaves. After we had passed the wood and had arrived upon a
good road, the bearers proceeded at a long walk approaching to a run.
Their wild chorus, which they sung as they went along,&mdash;their mischief
in throwing stones at the dogs by the road side, and in abuse,
half joking, half wishing for an opportunity of quarrelling, confident
in their numbers, and that as they were in the service of a white man
he would bring them out of any scrape;&mdash;was very strange, and had
I been less unwell, this journey would have much amused me. As
we passed through Olinda, a woman asked my men if they carried a
dead body (for it is in this manner that they are brought from a distance
for interment). One of the bearers answered, “No, it is the
devil<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>:” and then turning to me, said, “Is it not so, my master<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>?”
I said, “Yes,” and the good woman walked away, saying, “Ave-Maria,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
the Lord forbid<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>.” The wind was high and some rain fell,
as we crossed the Olinda sands; we arrived at Recife between nine
and ten o’clock. The bearers stopped before we approached the
gate way at the entrance of the town, that each man might, in some
way or other, conceal his long, unlawful knife; without one of these
weapons no peasant or great man leaves his home, notwithstanding
the prohibition.</p>

<p>I became gradually worse, until my recovery was not expected;
but the kind, attentive hand of another Englishman here again was
stretched forth. My former friend had left the country, but another
supplied his place, and from him I received every brotherly kindness.
I cannot forbear mentioning the following circumstances relating
to my illness. I went on board an English merchant ship,
some weeks after my recovery, and on passing a cask which was
lying upon the deck, I struck it intentionally, but without any particular
object. The master, who was an old gentleman with whom
I had come from England, and who had been long acquainted with
me, said, “Yes, you would not have it.” I asked him what he
meant, to which he replied, “It was for you, but you gave us the
slip this time.” I did not yet understand him, so he then continued,
“Why, do you think I would have let you remain among these fellows
here, who would not have given you christian burial? I intended
to have taken you home in that puncheon of rum.” I was told
by one of my medical attendants when I was recovering, that
some old maiden ladies, who lived near to where I resided, had frequently
pressed him, whilst I was in a dangerous state, to have the
Sacrament brought to me, for they were much grieved that I should
die without any chance of salvation. An English merchant of Recife
asked my particular friend when the funeral was to take place; and
one of the medical men wrote a note to the same person late one
night, enquiring whether his attendance on the following morning
had been rendered unnecessary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>As soon as I was well enough to remove, I took a small cottage
at the village of Monteiro, that I might have the advantage of
better air than that of Recife, and yet not be too far distant from
medical advice. Here I passed my time very pleasantly in daily
intercourse with a most worthy Irish family, of whom I shall always
preserve recollections of gratitude for the kindness which I received
at that time and on other occasions. On the night of my arrival at
Monteiro, one of my pack-horses was stolen, but the animal was recognised
some weeks afterwards by a boy who was in my service; the
man into whose hands he had fallen happened to pass through the
village, and thus I recovered the horse. It is astonishing to what a
great extent horse-stealing has been carried, in a country which
abounds so much with these animals. It is almost the only species
of robbery, for the practising of which regular gangs of men have
been discovered to have been formed; but these fellows will sometimes
also chance to lay hold of a stray ox or cow.<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>I was most anxious to return to Jaguaribe, and about the middle
of October was making preparations for the purpose; when the
manager arrived from the plantation, with the intelligence that one
of his assistants had been attacked two nights before, and nearly
killed, by some persons who had been commissioned to perform this
deed in revenge of some real or imagined injury which the man had
committed. This determined my proceedings; the following morning
I set off with the manager and a servant, to see the wounded man. I
found him at his father’s house, in most woeful plight; his face was
dreadfully lacerated, and his body much bruised; the work had been
done by bludgeons, and evidently in fear, else the task would have
been performed less clumsily and more effectually. I never could
discover by whom the murder was intended, nor the persons who
attempted it; they were dressed in leather, like unto Sertanejos; but
the sufferer imagined that this costume was made use of as a disguise.
Two men sprang out upon him, in a narrow lane which had high
banks on each side; he defended himself for some time with his
sword, but they overpowered him at last, and his weapon was the
only part of his property which they carried off. I removed altogether
from Monteiro in a few days; my presence had long been
necessary at Jaguaribe, for the mill was at work, and as frequently
happens in every country, some of the persons who were employed
had not remained empty handed.</p>

<p>The poor fellow who had been way-laid, soon returned to the plantation;
he told me that every night large stones were thrown violently
against his door, between the hours of one and four in the morning.
I called the manager the following evening, and both of us being
armed, we took our station near to the gate which leads into the field,
one being on each side, behind the high bank. We could hear the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
footsteps of any person long before he could approach us, as the
splashing in the rivulet which runs beyond the gate, would give us
timely notice. The musquitos gave us much employment; however
we remained at our post until half an hour before day break, without
seeing any thing; but the practice was discontinued. Two men had
arrived early in the night to offer themselves as labourers; they were
awake when we returned, had made a good fire upon the ground in
the mill (a spacious roof supported upon brick pillars) and were
sitting round it upon their heels; we joined them, and here I heard
their stories of their own prowess, of charms, and miracles, and other
conversation of the same nature, each of them telling something
strange which he had seen or heard.<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p>

<p>Much time had been lost, and the cane ought to have been
planted for the crop of the following year; the negroes in my possession
could not perform what ought to be done in proper time, and
therefore I collected free labourers for the purpose; and in a short
period between thirty and forty men, some of whom brought their
families, removed on to the lands of the plantation; and most of
them erected hovels of palm-leaves, in which they dwelt; but a few of
them were accommodated with huts of mud. There were Indians,
mulattos, free negroes, and slaves working together; a motley crew.</p>

<p>I had now taken up my abode at the house which was usually inhabited
by the owner or tenant; this was a low, but long mud cottage,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
covered with tiles, and white-washed within and without; it
had bricked floors, but no ceiling. There were two apartments of
tolerable dimensions, several small rooms, and a kitchen. The chief
entrance was from a sort of square, formed by the several buildings
belonging to the estate. In front was the chapel; to the left was a
large dwelling-house unfinished, and the negro huts, a long row of
small habitations, having much the appearance of alms-houses, without
the neatness of places of this description in England; to the
right was the mill worked by water, and the warehouse or barn in
which the sugar undergoes the process of claying; and to the view of
these buildings may be added the pens for the cattle, the carts, heaps
of timber, and a small pond through which the water runs to the mill.
At the back of the house was the large open field, the mill dam
beyond, and cottages, mandioc lands and trees along the valley, bordered
on each side by steep hills covered with thick woods.</p>

<p>Oftentimes I have sat at night upon the threshold of the door,
after all my people had retired to their habitations; they have supposed
that I was asleep; then I have heard the whisperings in the
negro huts, and have observed some one leave his house, and steal
away to visit an acquaintance, residing at some distance; or there has
been some feast or merry-making, thus late at night, thus concealed.
Neighbouring negroes have been invited, and have crept in during
the evening unperceived. It is on these occasions that plans for
deceiving the master are contrived; in these sweet unpermitted
meetings, the schemes are formed. Then the slave owner who is
aware of such secret practices, and reflects, must feel of how little
avail are all his regulations, all his good management. Restraint
creates the wish to act contrary to given rules. The slave has a
natural bias to deceive him who holds him in subjection. A man
may love the master whom he may at pleasure leave; but to be tied
down, and as a duty enjoined to esteem, fails not in most instances
to rouse contrary feelings, to awaken a sense of pleasure rather than
of pain, in counteracting the wishes, and in rendering nugatory the
determinations of him who commands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p>At other times far different ideas from these have occupied my mind;
I have thought of the strange life I was leading; a remembrance of
feudal times in Europe has crossed me, and I could not forbear comparing
with them the present state of the interior of Brazil. The great
power of the planter, not only over his slaves, but his authority over
the free persons of lower rank; the respect which is required by these
Barons from the free inhabitants of their lands<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>; the assistance which
they expect from their tenants in case of insult from a neighbouring
equal; the dependance of the peasants, and their wish to be
under the peculiar protection of a person of wealth who is capable of
relieving them from any oppression, and of speaking in their behalf
to the governor, or to the chief judge; all these circumstances combined,
tend to render the similarity very great. I even felt the power
which had unintentionally fallen into my hands. I had collected a
considerable number of free workmen, and the estate was respected
for miles round. Many of these fellows would have committed
almost any crime under the impression that my protection would
screen them; and if I had not turned some away, and threatened
others that I would aid the law rather than evade it, should their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
proceedings be irregular, I know not what evil deeds might not have
followed.<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p>

<p>Whilst I was unwell at Recife and Monteiro, the manager and his
wife had taken possession of the house; and here they remained for
some time after my return. Thus, I lived literally among these
people; I had indeed my meals alone, but generally two or three of
the persons employed upon the plantation were in the room, whilst I
breakfasted or dined, and they stood or sat talking to me. Any one
reached me a plate or ought else for which I asked, if he happened to
be near to what I wanted. The manager and his wife told me many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
strange tales; he was a man of feudal stamp, honest and faithful in
every respect, from personal regard to the man whom he served, but
not in general to the world; not from a principle of right and wrong.
This is very frequently the case among these people. He was however
of the right sort for what I wanted; and if I was again to travel
there, I should seek him out.</p>

<p>I had become somewhat intimate in several families of the neighbourhood;
but was the most amused with my acquaintance in those
of secondary rank, where there is less ceremony than among persons
of the first class. In the former, the females often appear, when the
visitor is a neighbour, has concerns with the master of the house, and
becomes intimate with him.</p>

<p>The Festival of St. Bento was to be celebrated about the close of
the year in the adjoining plantation, belonging to the monks of whom
he is the patron saint. The convent is at Olinda, and there the abbot
resides; the fraternity is rich, possessing much landed property.
Upon the estate adjoining to Jaguaribe, mandioc, maize, rice, and
other articles of food are cultivated, with which the convent is supplied.
The slaves upon it are in number about one hundred, of all
ages; and the last African died whilst I resided in that part of the
country. The festival, at which I intended to be present, was to our
Lady of the Rosary, the patroness of negroes. The expence which
was to be incurred was subscribed for by the slaves of the estate, and
the festival was entirely managed by them. Three friars attended to
officiate at the altar; but the lights, the fireworks, and all other necessary
articles were provided for by a committee of the slaves. The
manager of the estate was a mulatto slave, who made me a visit upon
my arrival at Jaguaribe, and on the occasion of the festival came to
invite me to the <i>novena</i> and to the <i>festa</i>, (the nine previous evenings
and the festival); or rather he came to request that I would not fail
to go, as he feared that my people and his might quarrel. I went
with a large party of men and women; we ascended the hill, and on
our arrival at its summit, I was invited by one of the black women to
enter her cottage, the same invitation being made to several other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
persons of our party. The chapel is placed quite upon the highest
point of the hill; and the house in which the friars dwell, when they
come to the estate, and the row of negro huts form a semicircle
about it, thus in part inclosing the chapel. These habitations look
down upon the broad river of Maria Farinha, winding below among
the mangroves, and there are several creeks on the opposite side,
which look like so many branches.</p>

<p>The crowd which had assembled was considerable, and was not a
little increased by my free workmen; some of whom were unmarried
men, unencumbered, and ready for any mischief. I was armed with
a long pike and the large knife of the country; and had brought
three of my slaves, accoutred much in the same manner,&mdash;three
resolute Africans, upon whom I could depend, and whose business it
was closely to watch their master. Before the commencement of
the prayers and singing in the chapel, the black people extended
several mats upon the ground in the open air; and our party sat
down upon them to converse and to eat cakes and sweetmeats, of
which many kinds were exposed for sale in great abundance. All
went on quietly for three nights, for the mulatto manager forbad
the sale of rum; but on the fourth night some liquor unfortunately
found its way up the hill, and Nicolau, the manager, came in haste
to inform me that a few of my Indians were earnestly bent on quarrelling
with a party of his people. I rose from the mat upon which I
had been seated, and followed by my body guard, accompanied him
back to the spot, where I soon saw that a fight had commenced;
persuasion was of no avail, and therefore my negroes made use of the
butt ends of their pikes, and brought an Indian to the ground, who was
delivered over to Simam, one of my fellows; and I desired the two slaves
who remained to assist the St. Bento negroes. I thus proved, that I would
not uphold my own people if they acted irregularly; and the matter
fortunately ended with only some trifling bruises, and one broken
head. The Indian was conveyed home by Simam, who returned to
tell me that he had placed the man in the stocks, with the intent of
sobering him. No more quarrels were entered into; for this affair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
quite sickened all those who might have been so inclined. In the
morning the Indian was set at liberty, and he quietly went off to his
work, not being much the worse.</p>

<p>I had great pleasure in witnessing the most excellent arrangements
of this plantation; the negroes are as happy as persons in a state of
slavery can be; but although the tasks are, comparatively speaking,
easy, and corporal punishments are only resorted to for children, still
the great object at which they aim is to be free, and to purchase the
freedom of their children<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a>. One man, who was a fisherman by trade,
had obtained the manumission of his wife, though he was still a slave
himself, with the intent that if she should still have any more
children, they might be free; and he purposed afterwards purchasing
his own freedom, and that of his young ones. Several instances of
the same behaviour are frequently occurring upon the estates belonging
to these and other friars. Thus every one wishes to be a
free agent; and it is this feeling alone which makes a St. Bento
negro do all in his power to be able to act for himself; for very probably
he may be obliged to labour with more diligence to obtain his
living as a free man than as a slave. The emancipated negro oftentimes
becomes an excellent member of society, for he contracts habits
of industry, in which he continues; but again, if he has been hardly
treated by a rigorous master, he becomes disgusted with, and indifferent
to life, is rendered callous to shame, and drags on an idle,
miserable existence.</p>

<p>Another festival was to take place at one of the chapels upon the coast,
which is dedicated to our Lady of the Conception. This was distant
one league and a half from Jaguaribe; however we formed a party
and mounted our horses one moon-light evening; the females riding
behind their husbands and relations, with a sheet or counterpane
thrown over the horse’s haunches, upon which they sat. We came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
out upon the sea-shore at the church of our Lady of the O, (of which
I shall presently speak) not far from the Fort of Pao Amarello, and
from thence proceeded along the sands to the place of our destination.
I was introduced to the family of an old Portugueze who resided here;
his son had just taken orders as a secular priest, and was to say his
first mass on the day of the festival. There were puppet-shows,
tumblers, and all their attendants in great abundance; fireworks and
bon-fires, noise, bustle, and no lack of quarrelling. Within the chapel
there was a display of wax tapers, praying, singing, and music, as
is usual.</p>

<p>The assemblage of persons was very considerable; indeed wherever
the surf is not violent the sea-shore is well-peopled, along the whole
extent of coast between Olinda and the bar of the river Goiana; in many
parts the low straw huts are united, or nearly so, in long rows for
half a mile together. White-washed cottages with tiled roofs are
frequently interspersed; churches and chapels have been built, and
few intervals of much extent remain unpeopled. The lands are
planted with the coco-trees, which is the most profitable plant of Brazil<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a>;
the coco-tree appears to be adapted to the sandy soil of the
coast, upon which only very few others will vegetate; here it flourishes
and seems to derive nourishment from its vicinity to the sea, but when
it is situated in rich land the coco-tree droops, and even upon the sandy
plains of the interior, it does not bear its fruit with the same luxuriance,
or reach that height, which it attains when exposed to the
sea breeze. These coco groves through which the eye can reach for
miles, with the hovels composed entirely of the leaves of these trees
spread among them, form in some parts very picturesque views; and
if, as frequently occurs, the cottage is situated upon the border of a
wood, just where the cocos end, and the dark green foliage of the
forest trees is seen behind, then the view is even romantic; and if
the wind is high, the rustling of the coco-trees, and the dashing
of the waves, increases much the wildness of the scene.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>

<p>However to return. As soon as the church service was ended we
mounted our horses, and rode back to Our Lady of the O. We
alighted at a cottage which stood near to the church, the inhabitants
of which were acquainted with some of our party; the moon was
bright and the breeze moderate. We sat down upon mats before
the door, and were regaled with quantities of young coco nuts, a most
delightful fruit when they are in this state. Some of us walked down
towards the beach; the tide was out, and I observed several large
blocks of hewn stone, partly buried in the sand below high water
mark. I enquired what had caused them to be there, and was answered,
that a church had formerly stood upon that spot; and I heard
then, and afterwards often saw, that the sea was making considerable
encroachments along the coast, to the distance of half a league or
more each way. The new church of Our Lady of the O. was now
building, at the distance of about three hundred yards from the
shore. Strange tales are told of the miraculous deeds of this lady.
When the church was about to be rebuilt, many of the landholders
of the neighbourhood were desirous of having the edifice upon their
ground; this proceeded from a religious feeling. Lots were drawn
to determine upon the site of the new church, and although manifestly
inconvenient, from many causes, it has been erected upon the
spot where it now stands, because the same lot was drawn three
times. A very great objection, and one which in common cases
would have been insurmountable, is that this is the lowest piece of
land in the neighbourhood, and is opposite to the place upon which
the sea is making the most rapid advances. Water too, for mixing
the lime and sand, must have been conveyed from a considerable
distance; but a spring of it gushed forth at the moment that one of
the labourers was making preparations for the commencement of his
work, and since the <i>capella-mor</i>, or principal chapel, has been built,
all kinds of diseases are said to be cured. The fame of this most
powerful lady has reached far and wide, and from the interior to the
distance of 150 leagues, persons who were afflicted with disorders which
had been considered incurable by human means, have come down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
to make their offerings to this avaritious personage, whose powerful
intercession is not to be obtained unless she is in return well paid
for her trouble.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></p>

<p>As the road from the Sertam to the sea-shore was by Jaguaribe,
I saw many of the travellers; I conversed with many wealthy persons,
whose sole errand was to offer part of their possessions, upon
condition of relief from the malady under which they suffered. The
patrimony of this church is now considerable, from the numerous
donations which have been made; some of these have been advanced
on credit, the donors being fully confident of repayment in the manner
which they desire; others have been made, owing to the persons
who gave them having been really cured;&mdash;faith has done what
medicine could not do. Such has been the reliance upon the efficacy of
the prayers which were offered up, and upon the power of the Lady,
that the probability of disappointment has never occurred to them;
and when the disorder proceeds more from the imagination than
from the body, I should suppose that a cure may be effected, much
in the same manner that in other countries cures are said to be performed
by medicinal waters; of which, although the qualities may be
very excellent, yet the name may surpass the reality, in bringing
about the desired end. The miracles of Our Lady of the O. are
performed in three ways&mdash;by prayer from the patient,&mdash;by drinking
the water of the spring or by application of some of it to the part
affected&mdash;and by eating or outwardly applying, a small quantity of
the salt which oozes from the wall against which the High Altar
stands<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a>. A village has risen up around the church, composed of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
huts for the sick, who have journeyed far from other districts. The
business has completely succeeded, the money which was required
for rebuilding the church has been obtained, and when I came away
the concern was going on prosperously. I heard the remark made
by some firm believers, that such was the sinfulness of the inhabitants
of the vicinity, that the Lady had scarcely vouchsafed to perform
any cures upon them. The wonderful stories of cures were always of
persons who lived in remote districts; but I did meet with a few
cases in which fancied illness from lowness of spirits was removed.
The general credulity of the lower orders of people, and even of
many individuals of the higher ranks, is beyond all belief; no persuasion,
no reasoning is of any service; even a doubt of the truth of
every story which is told is not admitted<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a>.</p>

<p>From hence we proceeded to pay another visit. The owner
of this cottage had no cocos to offer, but he would have
dressed some fish, and he gave us some wild fruits. The sail
of a <i>jangada</i> was extended for us, and we laid down for some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>time to converse. At a late hour we set off homewards, and
from carelessness lost our way; we wandered through the paths
of the woods of Mamanguape, until we judged (rightly, as it happened)
that we were in the road which would lead us to Jaguaribe.
There was much merriment notwithstanding the disaster, for
we knew that day-light would end our difficulties, and it was now
past two o’clock.</p>

<p>The mill was continually at work; I usually took the first
watch, and superintending the business until midnight; several of
my neighbours and their families came to amuse themselves in conversation,
and others came for the purpose of eating sugar-cane, of
which every one who has tasted must be fond.</p>

<p>About this time a female slave died in child-bed who was generally
regretted. She was a good servant, and an excellent wife and mother.
The grief of her husband bore much the appearance of insanity;
he would not eat until the following day, and then he only tasted
food from the persuasion of one of his children. Until the time of
my departure from Pernambuco, he had not recovered his former
spirits, and he never spoke of his wife without tears in his eyes.
Even some of the other slaves were, for a few days after her death,
unsettled; the rude instruments, upon which they were in the habit
of playing in the evening at their doors, were laid aside;&mdash;all merriment
was discontinued for some time.</p>

<p>I was requested about this period to be bride’s-man at the marriage
of a mulatto couple. I agreed, and on the day appointed, set
forth for Paratibi, accompanied by a free servant and a slave on
horseback. I arrived about ten o’clock, and found a large party of
people of colour assembled; the priest soon arrived, and he too was
of the same cast. Breakfast of meat and <i>piram</i> (a paste made of
<i>farinha</i>) was placed upon the table; some part of the company sat
down and ate, others stood, doing the same, and others again, as if
they were afraid of losing a minute’s conversation, continued to
talk loudly, and without ceasing. I have witnessed few such scenes
of confusion. At last we proceeded to the church, to which I begged
to be permitted to ride, for the distance was considerable, and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
was somewhat lame from an accident; as soon as the ceremony
was over, we returned to the house. The bride was of a dark
brown colour, for her father was a negro, and her mother of mixed
blood; she was dressed in a rose-coloured silk gown, and a black
veil was thrown over her head and shoulders; she wore white shoes
and white stockings with open clocks. The bridegroom was also of
dark colour; he wore a coat of brown cloth, a waistcoat of brocaded
silk, and nankeen pantaloons; he had on shoes with large
buckles, and a cocked hat. Both of these persons were young,
and they seemed to be dreadfully hampered with the increased
stock of apparel which they carried. The scene at dinner was a
counterpart of the breakfast affair, with the addition of more noise
and more confusion, which were caused by a larger assemblage
of people, and more plentiful draughts of wine and rum. I escaped
as soon as possible; but would not on any account have missed being
present at this day’s work.</p>

<p>On the night of Christmas eve, I did not go to bed; for we were
to hear the <i>Missa do Gallo</i>, or cock mass, as is customary. The
priest arrived, and the night was spent merrily. This person did not
at that time come regularly as a chaplain, but he was so engaged
afterwards.</p>

AND VALENTOENS.</p>

<p class="drop-cap13">ABOUT the middle of January, 1813, I went to stay for some days
at the cottage of an acquaintance, who resided upon the plain
of Barbalho, for the purpose of purchasing a few horses. This place
is near to the village of Monteiro; but it is on the opposite side of
the river. Barbalho is a plain of some extent, upon which cattle are
turned out to feed; the soil of it is a stiff dark-coloured clay, and the
grass which grows upon it is of a coarse species; this becomes quite
dry during the summer months, and when in this state it is set on
fire, that the tender shoots which again spring up may serve as food
for the animals that are to graze upon it. The fire will run along
the ground, urged by a fresh breeze; it will sometimes contract, and
at others spread each way, presenting to the beholders a fiery wall.
The sight is grand; it is upon a large scale, which gives to it a terrific
appearance. The inhabitants of the skirts of this plain carefully
preserve a circle around their houses and gardens, clear of vegetation;
apprehensive of some inconsiderate traveller who may chance
to light his pipe as he goes along, and throw away unextinguished the
fire-stick of which he has made use.</p>

<p>The person with whom I was staying persuaded me to ride with
him to the sugar plantation of Uninha, which is distant six leagues
to the southward of Barbalho; he described the place as being very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
beautiful, and I consented. This was the only opportunity which
conveniently offered itself of seeing the country in this direction;
but I much regret not having made greater exertions to visit the
southern districts of Pernambuco. We passed through the hamlet
and by the parish church of the Varzea. A considerable extent of
country is known under this name, containing some of the finest
cane lands of the province, which are owned by men of wealth, who
know the value of what they possess, and consequently the plantations
are in a flourishing condition. The Varzea is famous in Pernambucan
history, as the site of a great deal of fighting. Camaragibe,
which is in the vicinity, or rather a part of the Varzea, and
is spoken of by the historian of that country, is now a flourishing
sugar plantation.<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></p>

<p>We reached the sugar plantation of Camasari, belonging to the Carmelite
friars; it is in high order, that is, the slaves and cattle are in
good condition, and every thing upon it appeared chearful; but it does
not yield so much produce as it might, if the strength of the labourers
was pushed to the utmost. I looked into the mill, which is turned
by water, and saw some handsome mulatto girls feeding the mill with
cane; they were dressed in petticoats of printed cotton, and smocks
of cambric muslin, and they wore upon their necks and in their ears
gold ornaments; they were singing in parts very tolerably. The
difference between the plantations which belong to convents, and
those which are possessed by individuals who reside upon them, and
have a direct interest in every trifling increase or decrease of the
gains, is very striking. The estates of friars are worked almost exclusively
by negroes who have been born upon them; every thing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
goes on easily and regularly. If much is made, the better satisfied
is the chief for the time being; but if, on the contrary, little is obtained,
still the affairs of the community go on. We proceeded, and
at some distance beyond, descended from a high hill into a narrow
valley, which was completely embosomed by the eminences around,
and so enclosed that we appeared to intrude upon its inhabitants
in crossing this spot of their retirement. The grass upon the hills
was dry; but all below was yet in full health.</p>

<p>At length we arrived at the plantation of Uninha, which is situated
upon an extensive field, composed of uneven ground and watered
by several springs. The mill is turned by oxen, which is a late improvement;
horses being usually employed where water cannot be
obtained. We dined with the owner, and he returned with us to Barbalho
in the afternoon. I was much delighted with the day’s amusement.
This was the most beautiful part of the country which I visited
taken as a whole. The hills and the vallies are not high or extensive,
but they are decidedly marked. Here cultivation formed a considerable
feature in the country, the cane lands were extensive, and
the mills for its manufacture into sugar numerous.</p>

<p>On my return from Uninha, I wished still to remain at Barbalho
for a few days, and therefore the owner of the cottage at which I was
staying went on to Jaguaribe, to remain there until I could join him.
I staid with Manoel and Simam. One morning Manoel had gone to
cut a bundle of grass, and on his return met with an old acquaintance,
a creole negro; they quarrelled by the way, and as they came
near to where I was residing the matter became serious, and blows
were given and received, both of the men being armed with long
poles. Simam saw this, took up a drawn sword which was lying upon
a chair, and ran out to assist his comrade. I went out to put a stop
to the business, and discovered that Simam had cut an enormous
gash in the fellow’s head; the man was brought into the cottage and
his wound was dressed. An acquaintance of mine happened now to
come in, and he took charge of the negro, and carried him home to
his master. The negro was taking a load of grass for the governor’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
horses, who was residing at Monteiro, which is within half a mile of
the site of these transactions. Notice would have been taken of the
affair immediately, owing to the circumstance of the negro being employed?
for the governor, if His Excellency had not been informed
that the offending negroes (for such I consider mine to have been)
belonged to an Englishman, upon which no more enquiry was made;
and as it was discovered that the master had nothing to do with the
affray, no cognizance was taken of the matter by the military power.
If the owner of the wounded slave had chosen so to do, he might
have put me to much expence and trouble, for he might have accused
my negroes of assaulting his; but the law of itself seldom does
any thing. Even in cases of murder the prosecutor, or accuser as he
is called, has it at his option to bring the trial forwards or not; if he
can be bribed or otherwise persuaded to give up the accusation, the
matter drops to the ground. Thus the spirit of law is changed,
from the principle of bringing an offender to justice for the general
good of society, to that of prosecuting in revenge for the crime
which he has committed against an individual.</p>

<p>Soon after my return to Jaguaribe, I was one evening surprised
at the arrival of a white man, who was habited in uniform of blue
and red, and accompanied by a great number of loaded horses, and
of men, who were dressed in leather after the manner of the Sertam;
he delivered to me a letter, which I discovered not to be for me, but
for an Englishman who was occasionally with me; however, I of
course requested him to stay, and gave directions for the accommodation
of his followers. He was a commandant from the interior,
distant 130 leagues, in the back settlements of the province of Paraiba,
at the foot of the Serra do Teixiera. He had put on board
of <i>jangadas</i> at Paraiba a considerable quantity of cotton, which he
had brought down from his estate, and he was now travelling to
Recife for the purpose of receiving it, and of purchasing necessaries
or rather luxuries for his family; to which he appeared to be extremely
attached. We soon became intimate, and when he proceeded
to Recife at the close of a few days, he left some of his men and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
horses at Jaguaribe. It is among the inhabitants of places so remote
as the district from which he came, that clanship more particularly exists;
he had with him ten persons, most of whom were his <i>compadres</i>,
that is, the commandant was sponsor to one of the children of each.
This relationship is accounted very sacred in Brazil, and I believe in
all Roman Catholic countries; it is a bond of brotherhood, which permits
the poor man to speak to his superior with a kind of endearing
familiarity, and unites them in links of union, of which the non-observance
would be sacrilegious. The commandant made me several
visits from Recife, and after a delay of two months, he set off on his
return homewards. He was a man of most determined spirit, whose
name is respected all over the part of the country which he inhabits;
and this respect was produced by his wealth and individual
character, which brooks no insult; and yet there was a natural goodness
in his nature, which broke forth very strongly when he shewed
me the letters which he had received from his children, each of them,
even to the youngest, having written to him. He had lately lost
his wife; his manner of speaking of her was most affectionate. He
told me, that he had some intention of taking orders as a secular
priest.</p>

<p>Soon after the commandant left me the following occurrence took
place hard by, which is characteristic of the state of the country, and
similar to what frequently happens; although this of which I am about
to speak, might have been avoided, if the actors in it had been a little
older, and a little less hot-headed. A young man who resided in
this neighbourhood had been lately appointed to hold a military
situation in the district, of which he was proud, and owing to which he
had assumed an additional degree of personal importance. He possessed
a high-spirited horse, and would sometimes turn him loose,
although he had no fenced field into which he could put him. The
animal soon found out the cane land of an adjoining estate, and
destroyed, considerably, the young plants; from hence he would
open the gate of the field, (which from the manner that the gates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
of plantations are usually made, it was very easy for him to do) and
would come and offer battle to some of the hard worked horses.
This was often repeated, notwithstanding that the animal had been
caught each time, and sent home with a request that this might not
again occur. However, at last one of the beasts of the estate was
lamed by the horse, and rendered unfit for service, at least for some
time. The owner was much vexed, and as one of his slaves was
about to carry a message to some distance, he told him to ride
the officer’s horse. He went,&mdash;and the owner was informed of this;
he way-laid the slave, and took the horse from him. The planter
heard the next day, that the officer had expressed to many persons
a wish to meet him, however no notice was taken of this. As he
rode on the following morning to see his workmen, he saw the captain
in the path on horseback talking to a mulatto man. The planter
spoke to him, saying that he wished to pass, which he could not do
unless he moved, and mentioning at the same time that he was informed
of his wish to see him. The captain spurred his horse
towards his adversary, attempting at the same moment to draw his
sword; but this he did not do with ease, from some entanglement of
the belt. The other man drew his, which was inclosed in a walking-stick,
and rode up to him, putting the point close to his breast,
thus shewing him how easily he might by this unforeseen advantage
have taken his life. The mulatto man had now recovered from his
astonishment, and ran in between the horses, striking them and
driving them asunder. They still remained for some minutes in
high words; but the captain had not, as was afterwards well known,
supposed that the other was armed, and therefore his ardour for the
combat had now cooled considerably.</p>

<p>The Indians who were in my service, occasionally requested leave
to dance in front of my dwelling; I usually complied, and was often
much amused. A large fire was made, that we might the better see
what was going on; and that the evening might be rendered more
entertaining, I frequently invited some of my neighbours. The dance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
commenced by two men stepping forwards, and walking round and
round, taking a circuit of a few yards; one of them singing, or rather
reciting in a low voice some ditty of his own language, and the other
playing upon a shrill pipe; and as they went on, at intervals they
gave a hop or a skip; soon, a woman joined them, and walked after
them, and then another man came forwards, and so forth, until a large
ring was formed and the pace was quickened. It was always expected
that some liquor should be prepared for them, and each of these persons,
as they felt inclined to take any of it, stepped out of the ring, and
returned again as soon as they had drank. They continued dancing
as long as any rum was produced, the women as well as the men
relishing this, their means of inspiration; for as the quantities were
increased, some new song was introduced, the tones became louder,
and their articulation more rapid.</p>

<p>The free people of colour too would sometimes dance; but they
only asked permission of me, and held their merry-making at the
door of one of their own huts. Their dances were like those of the
African negroes. A ring was formed; the guitar player sat down in
a corner, and began a simple tune, which was accompanied by
some favourite song, of which the burthen was often repeated, and
frequently some of the verses were extempore, and contained indecent
allusions. One man stepped out into the centre of the ring,
and danced for some minutes, making use of lascivious attitudes,
until he singled out a woman, who then came forwards, and took her
turn in movements not less indecent, and thus the amusement continued
sometimes until day-break. The slaves would also request to
be permitted to dance; their musical instruments are extremely
rude: one of them is a sort of drum, which is formed of a sheep
skin, stretched over a piece of the hollowed trunk of a tree; and
another is a large bow with one string, having half of a coco-nut shell
or of a small gourd strung upon it. This is placed against the
abdomen, and the string is struck with the finger, or with a small bit of
wood. When two holidays followed each other uninterruptedly, the
slaves would continue their noise until day-break.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>

<p>I have now to enter upon an affair which gave me much trouble.
The lands belonging to the negro brotherhood of Olinda were very
conveniently situated for Jaguaribe, and for another plantation not
far distant, which was owned by an old man of colour, who harboured
around him a numerous clan of relations and dependants.
It was arranged that we should rent these lands equally; but to prevent
competition, one of us only was to apply for them, and then they
were to be divided. The owner of the plantation in question
was to make the application, and I rested satisfied; but I was surprised
to discover, that I run much risk of remaining without any
part of them; therefore I began to make arrangements for obtaining
them for myself. Whilst the matter was yet in doubt,
a person who was under the protection of the rival plantation,
sent a number of negroes to work upon some land which
lay very near to Jaguaribe. I sent a message to the owner of these
men, purporting that the land was tenanted by a person of my acquaintance,
who yearly rented it from the brotherhood, and therefore
I requested him to direct that his slaves should retire. This he
refused to do; consequently I collected a number of my free workmen,
and rode towards the spot in question; the matter had become
serious, and as he was aware that if a scuffle ensued, he might lose
the service of a slave, whilst I who was accompanied by free men,
would not sustain any loss, he gave the desired directions, and I
returned home.</p>

<p>I gained my object of renting the lands through the interest of
some persons who were intimately acquainted with the principal
officers of the brotherhood. I attended at the council table of these
black directors, and heard the arguments for and against the policy
of placing the whole of the property in the hands of one person;
however the matter was decided as soon as one of them rose up, and
reminded the rest that the community was in debt, and that the new
tenant was prepared with one year’s rent in advance. All objection
was silenced by this speech, and the papers were signed without
any farther remark. The black gentlemen came down to Jaguaribe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
to put me in possession of the lands. I had invited several of my
friends on this occasion, and blacks and whites all sat down and ate
together; the health of our Lady of the Rosary was drank first; then
that of the chief of the brotherhood and of the new tenant. These
fellows amused us much; for their politeness to each other, and to
the white persons who were present sat awkwardly upon them; but
was displayed to shew the importance which they imagined themselves
to possess. The <i>Juiz</i> or chief of the brotherhood was a shoemaker
at Olinda, and the rest were of the same rank in life, more
or less.</p>

<p>Possession was given to me, and every thing unpleasant seemed to
have subsided; when one night late, a mulatto man who resided at
Jaguaribe, knocked at my door, and told me that he had just arrived from
a visit to a neighbouring cottage, and that on the way, three men had come
out upon him, and had commanded him to stop; but on seeing him
alone, they had retreated. I had had some intimation of what I was
to expect, and immediately supposed by whom these persons must
have been sent, and for whom the blow was intended. I called two
Indians and my faithful slave Manoel, and accompanied by these,
and the mulatto man who had given me the information, I set off
towards the spot. They were gone,&mdash;but we pursued; however,
before we reached the nearest plantation, we heard the heavy gate of
its field shut to; therefore it was useless to proceed farther, for the
persons, whosoever they were, had reached a place of safety.
Upon this path resided the families of the neighbourhood with whom
I was the most intimate, and it was well known that I sometimes
returned home at a late hour. This was a turbulent district in which
I had fixed my residence. Some of the owners of the plantations
around were perpetually squabbling, and I had been led into the
same way of proceeding; indeed, if I had not done so, I should
have been trampled upon. The slaves of Paulistas and of Timbô
were constantly at war; and the owners of the plantations of Timbô
and Jenipapeiro were likewise with law-suits always pending, and
their dependants never easy. Some districts are in a quieter state<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
than others, but very few are totally without disturbance; and there
are few plantations in any part of the province about the boundaries
of the lands of which more than one law-suit has not been
entered into.<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<p>I was often reminded by many of my new acquaintances, that every
plantation ought to have a chaplain; and I was told, that without a
doubt all those persons who attended to hear mass, would contribute
towards the payment of the priest, as is customary. I spoke to a
young man of this profession for the purpose, and he attended every
Sunday and holiday; but when he was dismissed, at the time I was
preparing to leave the place, I was left to pay him entirely myself;
every one was poor and unable to assist when the day of payment
came. This was only what I expected; but I thought it was right
to follow the usual custom of having Mass said regularly, on account
of the slaves.</p>

<p>In April I arranged with the tenant of the lands which lie to the
eastward of Jaguaribe, and are called Maranguape, to allow me to
turn loose upon them all my cattle during the rainy season; for the
field of the plantation was not sufficiently large to support so great a
number of animals, during the whole year, as the work which was
performed upon it required. The lands upon which I intended the
cattle to remain are about one league in length, and of about half the
breadth. Part of them are under water in the rainy season, and in
other places they were covered with woods; but these were, for the
most part to be entered even on horseback, owing to the cattle
feeding in them, and beating down the brushwood. It was astonishing
to see in how short a period the cattle which had been accustomed
to labour, became wild and comparatively fierce. I was in
the habit of going occasionally with another person, both of us being
on horseback, to collect the animals for the purpose of seeing that
none were missing; we had many hard chaces after them, and got<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
many blows from the branches of the trees, &amp;c. One of the oxen
was in the habit of invariably going into a bog when we appeared, and
after having proceeded to a certain distance, he would turn round and
look at us with apparent unconcern, and as if he was conscious that
we could not reach him. This circumstance makes me recollect
another, which occurred with one of my pack-horses. The animal
escaped from Jaguaribe, and was not for a long time heard of; but at
last, I enquired of an old black man, who said that he saw him every
day. The horse fed upon some lands which produced excellent grass,
but the only water in the neighbourhood was to be obtained from a
well or hole, of which the entrance was narrow, and the water considerably
below the surface. The negro said, that one day he found
the horse near to the well, but unable to reach the water; he gave
him some, out of a half gourd, which the old man carried with him,
for the purpose of throwing water over his own head, in default of a
better bath. The following day the horse was there, and this continued
for weeks; but although he had attempted to put his hand
upon his neck, the horse never allowed him to seize his mane. He
was caught at last by two men, mounted on very swift-going horses,
whom I sent for the purpose.</p>

<p>A short time after the cattle had been at Maranguape, I agreed
with an Indian to go and stay there, for the purpose of taking care
of them. This man was in my debt for cloathing, and for a gold
chain which he had given to his wife. He came to me a few days
after his removal, asking leave to go to his former place of residence,
which was at some distance, and to take his family with him. I understood
what this meant; he would never have returned, and
therefore I answered that he might go if he thought proper, but
must leave some pledge for the payment of the debt. This he
promised to do. Julio, who had been with me on my journey to
Seara, was again in my service. He now displeased me exceedingly,
for he too, led astray by this fellow, wished to leave me; Julio had
been accused of some petty thefts, with which I now taxed him; he
denied having committed them, and that he was innocent I verily believe.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
However I did not think so then, consequently this circumstance,
and his wish to leave me with a man whom I knew to be
very unprincipled, for I had lately had information respecting him
from other quarters; and above all, the suspicion that they had come
at an hour when few persons were about me, under the impression
that, being alone, I should be induced to accede to their demands,
caused us to part on bad terms. They went their way towards Maranguape,
and I had some hopes that all would have continued quiet.
However in the afternoon, about half an hour before the close of
day, the manager came to tell me that Francisco Joze, the Indian
who was in my debt, had passed through the field, accompanied by
his wife, Julio, and a number of other Indians. Thus he had determined
to go in defiance of any right which I might have to his
services, or to demand payment of what he owed me, and in breach
of promise given to me only a few hours before. Several other labourers
were also indebted to me, and if this man was, without remark,
permitted to make his own terms, I knew not who might chuse to
do likewise.</p>

<p>My horse was brought out; I beckoned to Manoel, my constant
companion, and calling to some freemen, who had returned from
their work, and were now talking together in a groupe; I said, “who
follows me?” A black carpenter, a white brickmaker, a mulatto
carrier, and a labourer of the same cast, and likewise another slave,
stepped forwards. Thus accompanied by six able men, including
Manoel, who were all on foot, I set off on horseback at a round pace,
knowing that in ascending the hill, they would pass me. The hill
being surmounted, I again pushed on, and when I arrived at the
short, but steep declivity which overlooks the plantation of Inhaman,
I saw three men below, and heard the shrill Indian pipe. I looked
back and saw that the carpenter and brickmaker had alone kept pace
with me, and I know not how they were able so to do. I cried out,
“Yonder are some of the party.” At the same moment, Monte,
the brickmaker, fairly leapt down the steep declivity, and passed my
horse; we descended upon the men, but were disappointed in discovering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
that although they were Indians, they were not those which
we sought. Now we waited for the remainder of our party, who soon
came up, and we returned quietly by another path towards home.
On our arrival at the gate of Jaguaribe, I was informed that the
party had quartered itself in a corner of the field, in and about the
hut of another Indian; to this place we now directed our steps.
Francisco Joze himself came out to speak to me, and soon several
others placed themselves near to him. I sat on horseback, holding a
parley, my men being on the other side of me, until Antonio, the
mulatto carrier, (he who had been way-laid a long time before) came
round and leaned against the horse’s neck, placing himself between
me and the Indian. I afterwards found out, that he had observed that
Francisco Joze held a drawn knife, and Antonio judged that this was
intended against me or my horse, for the Indian well knew that if he
wounded me it would probably enable him to escape. Several persons
belonging to the plantation had now joined us, and the matter ended by
the Indian allowing himself to be taken without resistance, and to be
put into the stocks; a party of mulattos, or of creole negroes,
would not have submitted thus quietly. Late at night he paid the
debt, was released, and I saw no more of him for a considerable
time.</p>

<p>I was now dismissing all those workmen who were not in debt to
me, and at last only a few persons remained, whose services I required,
and upon whose character I could depend. It was very seldom
that I visited Recife, but when there was a necessity for so
doing, I took advantage of moon-light nights in preference to travelling
in the day-time, and was on these occasions accompanied by
Manoel. The wood of Merrueira, through which we usually passed,
is famous for the numerous stories of ghosts that wander, and of
murders that have been committed in it. One night when the
moon was not at a sufficient height to afford a tolerably clear view
of the objects around, we were passing through this wood. I saw a
figure before me in the middle of the path, which bore the appearance
of a man standing still. I slackened my pace and called out,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
as is customary, “Who comes there;” but before I could possibly have
received an answer, Manoel brushed past me, saying, “Let me see;”
however I desired him to be quiet, as no harm might be intended.
On a nearer approach, we discovered that an old stump of a tree had
caused this alarm. On another occasion I sent this same slave from
Recife to Jaguaribe, on foot, early in the morning, telling him that
I intended to follow him, leaving Recife about eight o’clock in the
evening. I was to be accompanied by Zacharias, another slave, whose
courage was somewhat doubtful. Manoel arrived at Jaguaribe and
immediately prepared one of the pack-horses, saying to the manager
that he was going to meet his master who was on the road alone,
for he said, “Zacharias is nobody<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a>.” The manager could not persuade
him to give up his intention, and therefore as he knew that
the slave was much tired with his walk, he came himself. I mention
these anecdotes for the purpose of shewing the kind of man, who
usually followed me wherever I went.</p>

<p>Several months now succeeded each other without any disquietude.
I had another attack of ague during the rainy season, which was however
much less violent than that of the preceding year. I likewise
met with an accident which had nearly proved fatal, occasioned by
a blow from the fore feet of a high fed horse; he reared and
struck me, but this was done more in playfulness than with the intent
to do mischief.</p>

<p>I had had some intention of leaving Jaguaribe, owing to the turbulence
of the neighbourhood, to my ill-health, and to some disagreeable
occurrences which had taken place between my landlord and
myself. However, as this would have been very inconvenient, I
resolved to stay, notwithstanding all these and other disadvantages.</p>

<p>Preparations were made in the month of August for setting the
mill to work; the cane had not attained this year its accustomed
growth, in most parts of the country, and that which I possessed was
particularly stinted in size, for I had not commenced planting until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
it was almost too late. Every thing being ready towards the end of
the month, I sent for a priest to bless the works. Unless this ceremony
is performed, every person who is to be employed about the
mill, both freeman and slave, would be afraid to proceed to his destined
labour, and if any accident happened it would be ascribed to
the wrath of heaven, for this breach of religious observance. The
priest arrived and said mass, after which we breakfasted and then proceeded
to the mill. The manager and several other freemen and the
negroes stood around the works; a quantity of cane was placed ready
to be thrust in between the rollers, and the four negroes whose part
it was to feed the mill stood at their posts. Two lighted candles were
placed close to the rollers, upon the platform which sustains the
cane, and a small image of our Saviour upon the cross stood between
them; the priest took his breviary and read several prayers, and at
stated places, with a small bunch of weeds prepared for the occasion,
which he dipped in a jug of holy water, he sprinkled the mill and
the persons present. Some of the negroes sprang forwards to receive
a good quantum of this sanctified water; and then the master of the
sugar boiling-house led the way to the portion of the works of which
he had the direction; and here there was another sprinkling. When
we returned to the part of the mill in which the rollers stood, the
priest took a large cane, and I did the same; then the signal being
given the flood-gate was opened and the works were soon in motion,
and according to rule the two canes which the priest and I held in
our hands were the first to be ground. I had heard much of this
ceremony from persons of the country, and I cannot avoid saying,
that although something of the ridiculous may by many persons be
attached to it, still I could not help feeling much respect for it. The
excitement of devout feelings among the slaves, even of those feelings
which are produced by the Roman Catholic religion, cannot
fail to be serviceable, and if men are to exist as slaves this is doubtless
the religion which is the best adapted to persons in a state of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>subjection. Slavery and superstition are however two evils which
when combined, are surely sufficient to cause the misery of any
country.</p>

<p>The carts, the oxen, and their drivers had not received the priest’s
benediction; they arrived some time afterwards, bringing loads of
canes, and the carts were ornamented with the longest that could
be picked out placed as flag staffs, and bearing upon them handkerchiefs
and ribbons. Each cart in succession stood before the
door of the dwelling-house, and the priest complied with the wishes
of the drivers.</p>

<p>There was a tall, thin mulatto man of about fifty-five years of age,
of the name of Vicente, who lived near to Jaguaribe; he was in
the habit, when he saw me about my own place, of stopping, that
we might have some conversation. I liked much to hear his stories.
He said, that now the country was becoming quieter,&mdash;that disturbances
were less frequent than formerly. That there were now
no <i>Valentoens</i>, valiant ones, nor any <i>contas verdes</i>, green beads<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a>. He
explained to me the precise meaning of the former, and the species of
beads which were intended to be described by the latter. These
<i>Valentoens</i> were men of all casts, whose whole business consisted in
seeking opportunities of quarrelling; they attended all festivals and
fairs, and their desire was to become so famous for courage as to render
the knowledge of their presence on these occasions sufficient to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
keep in awe any other individuals who might wish to create disturbances,
considering themselves privileged to revenge their own and
their friends’ injuries; but they would not allow of any quarrel in
which they were not concerned. Two roads cross each other at about
the distance of one league from Jaguaribe, and at this spot, Vicente
told me, that some of these men often stood, obliging all passers-by
either to fight them or to dismount, take off their hats, and lead their
horses whilst they were in their sight. These men wore round their
necks strings of green beads, which had either come from the coast of
Africa, bearing the wonderful property of conveying in safety their
possessors through all descriptions of perils, or were charmed by
<i>Mandingueiros</i>, African sorcerers, who had been brought over to
Brazil as slaves, and in secret continued the prohibited practice of
imparting this virtue to them. The men were accompanied by dogs
of extraordinary size and activity, and possessing courage equal to
that of their masters. These animals had been taught to drink rum,
which they would do at their owner’s command, giving to all beholders
an opinion of some supernatural qualities having been bestowed
upon them. Vicente had been acquainted with some of these
men, and was firmly persuaded of the virtues of the green beads, and
that the dogs imbibed from their masters certain qualities, which
made them superior to all the rest of their species. The expression
of the man’s countenance changed entirely when he commenced
the relation of these stories; it was at all times harsh; but now there
was imparted to it a considerable degree of unpleasant wildness.
When I expressed my doubts of the efficacy of the beads against a
musket ball well-directed, his anger rose, but there was pity mingled
with it, for one who had not seen those times of wonder. He seemed
to be glad that they were over, and that all was now quiet; but yet
he cherished a sort of regard for men whose lives had been passed in
deeds of danger; for notwithstanding the charms, such he considered
them to be, as the death of these men was generally violent, owing,
as Vicente said, to some unfortunate removal of the beads from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
person of him whose destined hour was arrived. It was not, however,
from this person alone that I heard accounts of the <i>Valentoens</i>.<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a></p>

<p>There was an old creole negro residing in the neighbourhood of
Jaguaribe, whose disposition led him to explore all the woods for
miles around in search of game; he preferred this manner of obtaining
subsistence to that of daily labour with the hoe or bill hook.
He was acquainted with the situations in which the best timber was
to be found; and could, in many instances, name the exact spot
upon which some particular tree stood, which was required for any
given purpose. This man often came to Jaguaribe, and on these
occasions I usually called him into the house to hear his stories,
whilst I sat in my hammock smoking. He was fond of tales of
ghosts and <i>Mandingueiros</i>. The latter are famous, among other feats,
for handling poisonous snakes, and can, according to his account
and that of many other persons, by peculiar noises or tunes, call
these reptiles from their holes, and make them assemble around
them. These sorcerers profess to render innoxious the bites of
snakes, to persons who submit to their charms and ceremonies.
One of the modes which is adopted for this purpose, is that of allowing
a tame snake to crawl over the head, face, and shoulders of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
the person who is to be <i>curado de cobras</i>, cured of snakes, as they
term it. The owner of the snake repeats a number of words during
the operation, of which the meaning, if they contain any, is only
known to the initiated. The rattle-snake is said to be, above all
other species, the most susceptible of attention to the tunes of the
<i>Mandingueiros</i>. The above accounts I should not have related upon
the authority of one or two persons. I have heard them repeated by
several individuals, and even some men of education have spoken of
the reputed efficacy of the tame snakes of the <i>Mandingueiros</i>, as if
they were somewhat staggered in their disbelief of it; the reputation
of the <i>contas verdes</i> is firmly established in the faith of those
persons of the lower ranks who have heard of them. These men
certainly do play strange tricks very dexterously.</p>

<p>I had not been so much inconvenienced by snakes as I had
imagined I should; I had seen several different kinds in going
through the woods, and particularly in that which leads from Jaguaribe
to Paulistas. The path through it is not much frequented, and
therefore the snakes have become bolder, crossing the road or running
up a bank as I passed along. One afternoon I had a visit with which
I could have well dispensed. I happened to look up whilst sitting in
my hammock, and saw one of these reptiles, lying quite still upon the
top of the wall of the room, in the opening which is formed by the
supporters of the roof that rest upon it. I seized a pike and ran it
into the snake, thus rivetting it to one of the beams of the roof,
whilst I called to some person to assist me in killing it; but its
writhing was so violent, that it soon liberated itself, and fell from the
wall on the outside, where several persons waited for it. The people
who were present did not know whether it was of the <i>caninana or papa
ovo</i> (egg eater) species, as these are much like to each other. The
former is accounted venomous, and the latter is by many persons supposed
to be harmless. Both are of a grey colour above, and yellow
underneath. The snake which we killed was about four feet in
length.</p>

<p>The <i>caninana</i> is likewise sometimes called the flying-snake, as it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
has the power of springing to a considerable distance. It usually
lies entwining the branch of a tree, and from thence darts down upon
those who may molest it. The <i>cobra d’agua</i>, or water snake, was
often to be seen in the rivulet which runs just below the dwelling-house
of Jaguaribe; it is sometimes eight or ten feet in length, and
of the thickness of a man’s arm. The colour of the back is a bright
black, and the belly is of a pale yellow. The lower ranks of people
say that it is poisonous; but I have heard this contradicted. The
<i>jararàca</i> snake is from six to nine feet in length; the back is of
a dusky yellow, and the belly is white; the point of the tail is black,
the mouth is red, and it has two black and white streaks upon the
throat. The <i>çurucucù</i> snake is of nearly the same size as the <i>jararàca</i>;
it is black and yellow. This reptile is attracted by fire, and on this
account would be more dangerous to travellers than any other
description of snake, if its attention was not so totally directed to
the fire, as to give time and opportunity of killing it. It has, as I
was informed by many persons of credibility, been known to spring
off the ground at a person carrying a flambeau. The <i>çurucucù</i> and
the <i>jararàca</i> are known to be poisonous. The <i>cypô</i> snake is so called
from its likeness to the thin and flexible shoots of the plants which
bear this name. It is said to be poisonous.</p>

<p>Charms are often supposed to destroy the venom of snakes, and to
produce, consequently, the recovery of the person who has been
bitten by one of these reptiles. Oil is sometimes used as a remedy,
being given in considerable quantities, which are increased or diminished
according to the quality of the oil. Rum is likewise administered
so as to produce intoxication. I have also seen a small
plant, which is known under the name of <i>herva cobreira</i>; wherever
I have seen it, the plant has been carefully preserved in a pot.
This would denote that it is not indigenous to the part of the
country in which I was; and indeed I was told that it had been
brought from Africa. I never saw its flower; the leaves of it are
small and heart-shaped; the stem is of four or five inches in length,
and of a deep red colour, which becomes greenish towards the points<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
of the branches: these are long, crooked, and spread horizontally.
The leaves and the softer branches are bruised, and are applied to
the wound, and the juice which is extracted from them, when mixed
with rum or water, is drank by the patient. I do not vouch for its
success; but its name must, I should imagine, have been acquired
by its reputation.<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a></p>

<p>The mill was yet at work in September, when the owner of the
place applied to me to leave it, as it was convenient to him to come
down from another plantation of which he was the owner, and reside
at Jaguaribe, from its vicinity to Recife. I agreed to this, but did
not wish that he should remove until I was about to leave Jaguaribe.
However, one morning, a young man who was related to and employed
by him, came to my house, and told me, that by order from
his kinsman he had (accompanied by a gang of negroes) taken possession
during the night of the cottage, which was situated upon the
shelf of the hill. I expressed my surprise at this conduct, and said a
good deal upon the subject. He, of course, returned for answer, that
he had only acted according to the orders which he had received.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
The principal objection which I had to this premature removal arose
from the general turbulent character of the slaves of this man, and
from the frequency of quarrels between the dependants of those persons
whose dwellings were so near to each other as ours had now
become.</p>

<p>Several extremely disagreeable occurrences took place, as I had
feared would be the case, before I could conveniently remove; but
as these proceeded more particularly from the peculiarity of our
situation I do not think that a minute account of them would be
interesting. These anecdotes could not be given in illustration of
the general state of manners in the country. Suffice it to say, that I
made a visit to the owner of the plantation of Amparo, in the island
of Itamaraca, upon whose lands I agreed to plant sugar-canes, and
to share with him their produce, as is a usual practice upon sugar
estates.</p>

<p>In the beginning of November, 1813, I sent my manager to prepare
a residence for me, at the town of Conception in the island; and
I removed to that place in the course of the following month.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XIII.</h2>

<p class="pch">REMOVAL OF THE AUTHOR TO ITAMARACA.&mdash;THE ISLAND.&mdash;CONCEPTION AND
PILLAR.&mdash;THE FESTIVAL OF OUR LADY OF THE ROSARY.&mdash;JOURNEY TO
GOIANA.&mdash;THE TOQUE.&mdash;THE COW-POX.</p>

<p class="drop-cap05">A FEW days after I had sent the remainder of my people to Itamaraca,
I gave up Jaguaribe to its owner, and rode to Recife,
where I remained for some days.</p>

<p>I had been introduced several months before to the vicar of
Itamaraca; and at the time that I crossed over to the island to agree
with the owner of Amparo about my removal, I made a visit to this
priest, and was received by him with the greatest cordiality. As the
plantation of Amparo had no cottage unoccupied at that time, or
indeed that was fit to be inhabited, I requested the vicar to obtain for
me a house in the town, as it is called, of our Lady of the Conception,
in which stands the parochial church of this extensive vicarage.
He returned for answer, that excepting his own residence, of which
he was willing to give up to me a portion, and the prison, no dwellings
could be met with. However, he desired that I would send a person
to speak to him; this I did, and on the man’s return, the offer of the
prison was accepted.</p>

<p>As I had written to mention the day upon which it was my intention
to arrive there, I was received by one of my people upon the
shore of the main land; and the canoe which plies for the purpose of
carrying passengers across, was ready to take me. The saddles were
removed from the horses’ backs, we entered the canoe, and shoved
off from the shore, the horses swimming by the side of it. The passage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
across, is, at this its narrowest part, about half a mile. On landing
upon the island, we saddled the horses, and rode for about one
quarter of a mile along a sandy path, which is bordered to the left
by the water of the channel that runs between the island and the
main, and on the right by coco-trees, until we reached a narrow
creek, which is not fordable at high water and in this state we now
found it. I left the horses to the care of Manoel, until they could be
passed conveniently, whilst I followed the man who had come to
receive me. We proceeded over the bridge which was constructed
of loose beams, and scarcely safe even for foot passengers; immediately
beyond it we passed by several cottages with mango trees
before them, and then ascended the steep hill, upon the summit of
which stands the town, built in the form of a square. We entered it
at one corner, and near to my new habitation, which was a large stone
building, much dilapidated, with one story above the ground floor.
In the prosperous days of this settlement, when its rank in the province
was considerable, this edifice was raised as a town-hall above,
and prison underneath; but now that the decay of the place had
rendered it unworthy of its former distinction, the building was no
longer kept in repair, and was now almost in ruins.</p>

<p>The island of Itamaraca, which is in length about three leagues,
and in breadth about two, is situated at the distance of eight
leagues to the northward of Recife, and is entirely separated from the
main land by a channel of unequal width, varying from one league
to half a mile. The island does not contain any stream of
water, but in the neighbourhood of the town water gushes from the
hill wherever it is dug for. That which is obtained from the springs
in the neighbourhood of Pillar, is not however good. Itamaraca is,
perhaps, the most populous part of the province of Pernambuco,
taken as a whole, the immediate vicinity of Recife excepted. It
contains three sugar mills, which are well stocked with negroes; and
many free persons likewise reside upon the lands belonging to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
them<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>. Besides the lands attached to these works, there are other
considerable tracks which are subdivided among and owned by a
great number of persons of small property. The shores of the island
are planted with coco-trees, among which are thickly scattered the
straw cottages of fishermen; and oftentimes are to be seen respectable
white-washed dwellings, which are possessed by persons whose
way of life is frugal, and yet easy. The salt-works upon the island
are likewise one great source of its wealth; these are formed upon the
sands which are overflowed by the tide at high water.</p>

<p>The long village of Pillar, situated upon the eastern side of the island,
is at the present day the principal settlement, although that which is
called the town of Conception, where I now resided, standing upon the
S.E. side of the island, claims seniority, but its better times are gone
by; its situation was considered inconvenient, others are at present preferred;
and if the parish church did not stand here, and render
necessary the presence of the vicar, the place would shortly be deserted.
It has now a desolate neglected appearance, an unpleasant
stillness, producing sensations of a very different description from
those which are excited by the quietude of a place that has never
witnessed busier scenes. Its site is the summit of the S.E. point
of a high hill, which rises almost immediately from the water’s edge.
The square, in which are situated the parish-church,&mdash;my new residence,&mdash;the
vicarage, a low, long, white-washed building,&mdash;and about
fifteen cottages, is very spacious; but large pieces of ground now remain
unoccupied; the houses which stood upon them have been removed,
or have been allowed to decay and fall, giving room to banana and
tobacco gardens. The centre of the square was covered with brushwood,
and a narrow path went along the four sides of it immediately in
front of the houses, which afforded to the inhabitants the means of
communicating with each other. There is one street branching from
it and leading down towards the creek, over which I passed on my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
arrival; it is formed of small low huts, and is closed at the end farthest
from the square, by a church, which is dedicated to our Lady of the
Rosary, the patroness of negroes.</p>

<p>The harbour is good, and the entrance to it is commanded by an
old fort, which is much out of repair; the garrison is scanty, and
without discipline. On one occasion I took a canoe, and went down
to the bar. I wished to sound, but my canoe-man begged that I
would not, as it might bring him into trouble; and indeed we were in
sight of the fort, and the commandant is jealous, being an elderly
man and an advocate for the old system of exclusion. The entrance
to the port is formed by an opening in the <i>recife</i> or reef of rocks
which runs along the whole of this part of the coast. This opening
is of considerable width, and its depth will admit of large vessels;
but I could not obtain exact information upon the subject. From
the main land on one side, and from the island on the other, two long
sand banks jut out on each side of the channel, which separates
Itamaraca from the continent. These banks are dry at low water, and
at neap tides are not completely covered. They shoot out so far that
they nearly reach to the reef. The bar is easily discovered from the
sea, as it is immediately opposite to the channel or river into which it
leads, and as there are breakers to the northward and southward, but
none are to be seen at the place which is to be entered. Having
entered the bar, some small breakers will be seen a-head, or rather
towards the south side of the channel, unless the tide is out, and then
the water is quite still. These breakers are farther in than the outermost
point of the south sand-bank. They are formed by some rocks
which lie at a considerable depth below the water’s edge. I tried to
reach them with a pole of two fathoms in length, at low water during
spring tides, but did not succeed; and my canoe-man said that he
doubted whether another fathom and a half would touch them. The
passage for large vessels is between these rocks and the north sand-bank,
for the passage between them and the south bank only admits
of small craft. I could not learn that there were any other rocks or
banks than these which I have mentioned. The anchorage ground is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
opposite to the fort, and on the outside of it; but opposite to the
town of Conception, which is farther in than the fort, there is considerable
depth of water. Some parts of the ground are rocky, but
others afford safe riding.</p>

<p>The magnificent prospect which may be enjoyed from the clumsy
wooden balcony of the town-hall, compensates in some degree for the
dismal state of the place in which it stands. In front is an extensive
view of the sea, which is always enlivened by numerous <i>jangadas</i> and
canoes sailing to and fro, and occasionally by the large craft that trade
between Maranham and Recife, and by ships arriving from Europe
or returning thither. To the right is the broad channel immediately
below, and the bay which it forms on the opposite side, with the
picturesque village of Camboa upon its shores, and the pointed hill
of the Engenho Novo, covered with wood, rising behind it; but as
this hill does not extend far, and rather rises in the form of a cone,
the river Iguaraçu runs along the plain, and is now and then discovered,
but oftentimes concealed, by the dark green mangroves;
these however sufficiently point out its course, and lead the eye to
the white specks which beautifully mark the site of the higher buildings
of the town of Iguaraçu, peeping out among the vast expanse of
wood of a lighter green, which reaches as far as the eye can compass.
To the left is a narrow and deep dell, bounded on the opposite side
by a ridge of rising ground of equal height with that upon which
the town is situated. Behind is the flat plain, which runs along the
hill to the distance of one league; it is in places much contracted and
in others spreads widely.</p>

<p>The town of Conception was formerly fortified; the three sides
upon which it is enclosed by the steep declivity to be ascended in
reaching it, have been rendered still more precipitate, even than they
would naturally have been, as they are cut perpendicularly to the
height of twelve feet, presenting a wall of earth to those who ascend
the hill, and as the soil is a stiff clay, and the passing and repassing
not considerable, the paths which have been formed through
the wall are still exceedingly steep. On the fourth side, entrenchments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
were made across the plain upon the summit of the hill; these were
shewn to me; for it was necessary that they should be pointed out,
as they were almost concealed by the brushwood; and even large trees
which were growing in them. Upon one spot, on the quarter nearest
to the sea, and now the site of a cottage, is still plainly to be discovered
the situation of a fort, and a short time ago a gun, which
appeared to be of six pounds calibre, was dug up.</p>

<p>The distinctions attending the rank of a town were removed some
years past from hence to Goiana, and the only mark which Conception
still possesses of its former importance, is the obligation by
which the magistrates of Goiana are bound to attend the yearly festival
to the Virgin at the parish church.</p>

<p>Itamaraca is one of the oldest settlements of the Portugueze upon
the coast of Brazil. It was given to Pero Lopes de Souza, who took
possession of it in 1531.<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> The Dutch made an attack upon it in
1630, and although they did not succeed in taking Conception, they
built a fort which they called Fort Orange<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a>, and this is the fortress
which now exists upon the island. However, in 1633, the Dutch
“dispatched such a force as rendered resistance hopeless; the
town of Conception was yielded to them, and with it the whole
island<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a>.” In 1637, the Dutch deliberated, “whether the seat of
government should be removed to the island<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a>.” This did not take
place; the opinion of those who proposed the plan being over-ruled,
but I cannot avoid thinking that it possesses many advantages of
which Recife cannot boast. The port of Itamaraca may not admit of
vessels of so much burthen as the Poço harbour of Recife, but the
former is much more safe even than the Mosqueiro port. If Brazil
was to be at war with any naval power, Recife might be destroyed
with ease, whereas if a town had been erected upon the main land,
opposite to the island, or upon the inside of the island, it could not
be molested by shipping, for it would be necessary that a vessel should
enter the channel before she could bring her guns to bear. Besides<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
this advantage, Itamaraca and the neighbouring shores of the main
land, enjoy those of wood and water in abundance, in the latter of
which Recife is particularly deficient. In 1645, Joam Fernandes
Vieira, the principal hero of the Pernambucan war, attacked the
island, but did not succeed in dislodging the Dutch<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a>. The Portugueze
again attempted to regain possession of it in 1646; they crossed
over at a place called Os Marcos<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a>, which is now a coco-tree plantation,
and a large house is built upon it; the property belongs to a
Portugueze cattle-dealer who resides chiefly at Iguaraçu. Opposite
to Os Marcos is the shallowest part of the channel. The Portugueze
did not gain their point entirely, “but the Dutch abandoned
all their other posts to retire into the fort”<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a>, which was not surrendered
to the Portugueze until the expulsion of the Dutch in 1654.<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a></p>

<p>I happened to arrive at Conception upon the day of the festival,
the 8th of December, however as I had many matters to arrange, I
did not see the ceremony in the church, but was invited to dine with
the vicar. I went at two o’clock, and found a large party assembled,
to which I was happy in being introduced, as it consisted of several
priests who are the men of most information in the country, and of
some of the first laymen of the island. The dinner was excellent
and elegant, and the behaviour of the persons present was gentlemanly.
I was placed at the head of the table, as being a stranger; and a friend
of the vicar took the opposite end of it, whilst he himself sat on one
side of me. I never met a pleasanter dinner-party, there was much
rational conversation and much mirth, but no noise and confusion.
The company continued together until a late hour, and indeed the
major part of the priests were staying in the house.</p>

<p>The parish of Itamaraca has now for some years enjoyed the blessings
which proceeded from the appointment of the present vicar,
Pedro de Souza Tenorio. His merit was discovered by the governor,
whom he served as chaplain, and by whose application to the
Prince Regent was obtained for him his present situation. The zeal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
of the vicar, for the improvement of the districts over which he has
controul is unremitted; he takes pains to explain to the planters
the utility of the introduction of new modes of agriculture, new machinery
for their sugar-mills, and many alterations of the same description
which are known to be practised with success in the colonies of
other nations; but it is not every novelty which meets with his approbation.
It is no easy task to loosen the deep-rooted prejudices of
many of the planters. He is affable to the lower ranks of people,
and I have had many opportunities of hearing persuasion and entreaty
made use of to many of his parishioners, that they would reform
their habits, if any impropriety of behaviour in the person to
whom he was speaking had come to his knowledge. His occasional
extempore discourses on subjects of morality when seated within the
railings of the principal chapel, delivered in a distinct and deep-toned
voice, by a man of commanding person, habited in the black
gown which is usually worn by men of his profession, were very impressive.
He has exerted himself greatly to increase the civilization
of the higher orders of people in his parish; to prevent feuds
among them;&mdash;to persuade them to give up those notions of the
connection between the patron and the dependant, which are yet too
general; he urges them to educate their children, to have their
dwellings in a state of neatness, to dress well themselves, their wives,
and their children. He is a good man; one who reflects upon his
duties, and who studies to perform them in the best manner possible.
He has had the necessity of displaying likewise the intrepidity of his
character; his firmness as a priest, his courage as a man, and he has
not been found wanting. He is a native of Pernambuco, and has
not degenerated from the high character of his provincial countrymen;
he was educated at the university of Coimbra in Portugal.</p>

<p>From the state of society and government in Brazil, the individual
character of the person who holds any office of importance
makes a most wonderful difference, and indeed in some districts a
man of an active mind with some wealth, but without any appointment,
has more weight than a person of a contrary disposition,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
although the situation of the latter might give him great power, if
he thought proper to exert himself.</p>

<p>I passed some portion of each day with the vicar and his party;
the conversation never flagged, and I often thought how very superior
the persons were with whom I associated, to any that my friends
in England could suppose a country residence in Brazil to afford.
I was myself agreably surprised at the change which I had made
from Jaguaribe.</p>

<p>Among the visitors at the vicarage was Joam Ribeiro Pessoa de
Mello Montenegro, professor of drawing to the seminary of Olinda,
and the friend and disciple of Dr. Manoel Arruda da Camara. This
priest, during his stay at Itamaraca, crossed over to the mainland
to say mass at the village of Camboa every Sunday and holiday.
I accompanied him on one of these occasions, and we were
paddled over in a canoe. We entered the cottage of a man of colour,
the chief person of the place; a hammock was hanging in the room,
and into this my companion threw himself, and three or four children
of the house quickly came to him, one or two of whom he took into
the hammock to play with. The females made their appearance to
greet him upon his arrival; he was a favourite seemingly with all parties,
great and small. Indeed I never met with any one who possessed
more pleasing manners. He is generally beloved wherever
he is known, but by the lower orders of people more especially, he
is quite adored. I was long acquainted with him, both before and
after the time of which I speak, and I never heard him make use of
a harsh word to any one; his manner and his tones of voice always
indicated that goodness in him greatly predominated. A free mulatto
man, of the name of Bertolomeu, once said to me in speaking
of this priest, “If he sees a child fall, he runs and picks it up and
cleans its face, and this he does not do, because any one is in
sight to see him act in this manner, but because his heart so inclines
him<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a>.” It is much to be lamented that his exertions have not been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
directed to obtaining a situation in which his excellent qualities
might have a wider field for display; but he is satisfied with what
has been given to him.</p>

<p>I was much surprised at the manner in which even the people of
colour dress themselves to go to mass in all the villages; if the family
is in a respectable way of life, the younger females wear on these occasions
gowns of printed cottons, English straw bonnets, stockings also of
foreign manufacture, and neat shoes which are made by workmen of
the country. The young men appear in nankeen pantaloons, and jackets
of printed cottons, shirts of cambric muslin, hats of English
make, stockings and shoes. Indeed, of late years, since articles of
dress have been cheap, and have come into general use,&mdash;since a
subject of emulation has arisen, and the means of shewing it has
been afforded, every hamlet sends forth its rival belles and beaux.</p>

<p>I was disappointed with a near view of Camboa; but the country
behind it is picturesque, being formed of uneven ground, which is for
the most part covered with wood; and cottages and mandioc lands
are interspersed. The village consists of one street, composed of
small dwellings. The inhabitants are mostly related to each other,
and the free persons are of mixed blood. The clan is large, but there
does not reside here any wealthy white man; they are a quiet, inoffensive
people. The old man at whose house we staid whilst the neighbours
assembled to hear mass, was respected by all the rest; he had
the management of all their weighty concerns, as being the richest
person of the place, though even his property was small; and as he
was connected in natural or religious relationship with the major
part of the inhabitants. When the priest and I went into the house,
we found a large party sitting round a table and playing at cards,
which these persons continued to do until the church-bell rang, and
the priest went out to prepare for saying mass. The majority of
the people of all classes, excepting Indians, have a great propensity
to gaming.</p>

<p>There lived at this village formerly a poor man who died of consumption,
dragging on for some time a miserable existence. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
opinion is general in Pernambuco and other parts which I visited,
that consumption is contagious; and from this notion, any person so
afflicted is immediately separated from the rest of the family. A
hovel is erected at a distance from any habitation, and the miserable
patient is removed to it, and is shunned by every one, even receiving
his food without the bearer approaching the hovel. I can conceive
no situation more wretched than this,&mdash;to be in a weak and helpless
state, and to be forsaken,&mdash;to be doomed to solitude, and to have,
perhaps for years, no thoughts but those of death; nothing to relieve
the mind, and to divert the attention. I know not, however, whether
the opinion of contagion respecting this disorder is totally founded on
prejudice, or whether there is some truth in it; for I have heard from
persons who are not liable to hasty decisions, many stories which
seem to indicate that there is some reason for the precautions which
are taken. They are, doubtless, carried too far; they are insisted
upon to a savage excess, which fails not to bring to the recollection
the custom of some tribes of Indians, who forsake their aged,
their infirm, and their dying kinsmen.</p>

<p>I frequently visited the plantation of Amparo, which is conducted
in the manner which I had attempted at Jaguaribe; but here it was
performed with more system. The owner of this place employed
constantly great numbers of free workmen, of all casts; but the
Indians formed the principal part of them, and as their master, I
suppose, finds it impossible to keep them under due controul, (for the
wish to do so he must of course have,) the disturbances which are
raised upon the estate, and which are entered into at other places by
his men are very numerous<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a>. But this person would have done
much service to the country in general, if he had managed to keep
them in due order, for in that case he would have proved the possibility<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
of the introduction of free men as daily labourers, without
the opinion of their unruliness being unavoidable, having been
adopted by great numbers of the planters. The state of Amparo is
often mentioned as an objection to hired labourers, from the want of
reflecting that in the instance in question, the evil proceeds not from
the plan itself, but from its execution. It is too true that the
lower orders of people are unruly, and upon slight provocations,
murders have been committed; but does not this proceed from the
propensity which the higher ranks shew to protect those who reside
upon their lands? Thus they display their influence with men in
office, when they plead for the pardon of a criminal, and feel a considerable
degree of gratification,&mdash;of self-importance in the idea that
an individual should have been preserved from punishment by their
means, even though he had only been treated according to his
deserts if he had not been screened. Where government exists
in a state similar to that of Brazil, wealth will meet with few
obstacles in the accomplishment of its purposes, whatever these
may be.<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a></p>

<p>In the month of January, 1814, the vicar summoned me to accompany
him to Pillar, to which I agreed with much pleasure. The
master of the grammar school, Ignacio de Almeida Fortuna, who is
likewise a priest, was of the party; he is a man of considerable
talent and information. His advantages have been very few, for he
has resided almost entirely upon this island; and yet his knowledge is
far from being limited, and his love of it is unbounded. We crossed
the narrow creek which has been already mentioned, and proceeded
along a path under the shade of the coco-trees, until we made for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
sands. The sea has made great encroachments for about two miles
in this part of the island; we passed the mouths of two natural dikes,
into which the tide enters with great rapidity, and is discharged again
with increased velocity. After a ride of an hour and a quarter, we
reached Pillar, which is distant from Conception, two leagues. This
village is composed of several irregular streets, formed of small houses
of various descriptions; they are constructed of brick, of mud, and of
the coco-leaves. It is a place of some trade, and is likewise frequented
by the small craft, which sail between Recife and Goiana.
The inhabitants support themselves by their fisheries, by the hire of
their <i>jangadas</i> and canoes, and lately, by the preparation of the outward
husk of the coco-nut<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> for the manufactory of cordage, which has
been recently established in the vicinity of Recife. The fishery of
Pillar is of considerable importance. The largest portion of the fish
which is caught upon this and the adjacent coast, is obtained by
means of pens, that are generally constructed near to low water mark.
Two spaces of greater or less magnitude are marked off, and stakes
are driven into the sand at given distances in quadrangular form; to
these stakes are fastened large mats (<i>esteiras</i>) of basket-work made of
thick twigs. An aperture, constructed in a similar manner to that of
a trap for catching mice, is left in the inclosure farthest from the
shore, opening into the second or smaller inclosure, which has likewise
an entrance on the land side, from which runs a fence of basket-work
to high water mark. Thus the fish that come in contact with
this fence naturally continue along it, in expectation of finding an
opening by which to escape, until they unintentionally enter the pen.
The <i>jangadas</i> also go out to sea, and fish with the hook and line,
and many kinds of nets are used. Yet there is at times a great
scarcity of fish, which is rendered by the ordinances of the Romish
church an absolute necessary of life. I was introduced at Pillar
to a Portugueze gentleman of great respectability, from whom I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
received in the sequel much civility; the vicar also made me acquainted
with a gentlemanly Brazilian priest, who was a young and
well-educated man. The former of these persons had been the
<i>Juiz Ordinario</i> or Mayor of Pillar, in the year 1812. He had seen
how dreadfully the want of due attention to the duties of this office
had been felt on former years, and now he was determined to act in
the manner which his situation required. He said, that in building
great cities, the first public edifice which was or ought to be raised,
was the prison; and therefore as Pillar was becoming daily of more
importance, it was fit that it should have this requisite edifice. He
ordered a number of trees to be cut down, and in a few days a roof
was built of small but adequate dimensions, and supported by some of
of these trees; the remainder of the timber was to form the walls of the
building after the manner of a stockade. A rude door was likewise
made, and a pair of stocks was put into the place. “Now,” he said,
“Pillar will thrive.” He apprehended some unruly fellows with his
own hands; he is a large and powerful man, and the requisite though
dangerous task of arresting the men who created disturbances was
performed by him with apparent unconcern, and as if he was occupied
in any common occurrence of his life. Notwithstanding the
acknowledged benefit which was produced by the administration of
this man, such is the state of government, that interest was made to
prevent his re-appointment to the office on the following year; and
this influence was successful. He was too upright a man to be liked
by those who wished to have upon their estates a number of turbulent
dependants.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of the island had entered into a subscription for
building a bridge over the creek near to the town; this work was
undertaken through the zeal of the priests who resided in Itamaraca,
and was about to be executed under the direction of the master of
the grammar-school.</p>

<p>I was much surprised in the beginning of the month of February,
at the arrival of a mulatto slave, who had absconded in November;
he came alone, and without the customary note from some person of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>my acquaintance, requesting him to be forgiven. He ascended the
steps of the place in which I resided, with perfect unconcern, and with
his knife in view and a stick in his hand, begged to be pardoned.
I desired that some food should be given to him, and he remained in
the kitchen during the night. However, I could not help suspecting
some evil intentions, for I knew he had been staying upon the estate
of a man who bore me no good will. He went off, by my order, in
the morning, to assist three free labourers in the work of cutting up
some trees that had been felled. I followed him to the ground about
ten o’clock, as was my usual custom. I called him to me, under the
pretence of wishing to have the curb chain of my bridle loosened;
he came, and then I put one hand upon his head, and with the other
drew a pistol, at the same time desiring him to throw down his hatchet
and his knife, which he did. Then I called to two of the freemen,
that they might secure him. The mulatto’s hands were tied behind
his back, and I followed him and his conductors to Amparo, from
whence I wrote to my new friend at Pillar, forwarding the slave to
that village. He was there placed in the stocks, until I could dispose
of him, which I immediately entered into measures for effecting.
I never saw him again. He was a bad fellow, and had twice attempted
the life of the persons under whose orders he was placed.
He had run away in November from having drawn his knife, and
having threatened to stab the manager with it.</p>

<p>There is another road to Pillar, besides that by which the vicar
had taken me; it is through a place called Engenho Velho (the old
mill). Sugar works were formerly established here; but the lands
are poor, and the large red ants upon them are so numerous, as to
render their cultivation almost impossible; so much so, that scarcely
any persons reside upon them. Many individuals of the lower classes,
first obtaining leave from the proprietor, have attempted to rear crops
of mandioc and maize upon them; but their exertions have seldom
enabled any one to prevent the plantations from being destroyed by
the ants. Huts are to be seen, out of which the inhabitants have
been driven by these tormentors; the shelter which the roofs afford
is convenient to the ants, and under them they like to form the chief<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
entrances to their cities. I never saw any other situation in which
this pest of Pernambuco<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> had so completely taken possession of the
land. The hillocks under which they had formed their nests were
innumerable; some of these were four feet in height, and ten or
twelve in circumference; others were of less dimensions, and some of
them might be larger.</p>

<p>Some ruins of the mill are still to be seen at Engenho Velho, and
there is a pond near to them of considerable depth, of which tradition
says, that great riches lie concealed at the bottom. I also heard
of an old African negro, who has been manumitted, and now practised
the arts of a <i>Mandingueiro</i>, in this neighbourhood. Among the
lower orders of people I have heard his powers discussed. It is said,
that he can cause the death of any one who is pointed out to him;
the unfortunate person will linger for a long time, but his destruction
is inevitable. This old man is likewise a fortune-teller, and is applied
to in cases of unrequited love.</p>

<p>In March took place the yearly festival of our Lady of the Rosary,
which was directed by negroes; and at this period is chosen the King
of the Congo nation, if the person who holds this situation has died
in the course of the year, has from any cause resigned, or has been
displaced by his subjects. The Congo negroes are permitted to elect
a king and queen from among the individuals of their own nation; the
personages who are fixed upon may either actually be slaves, or they
may be manumitted negroes. These sovereigns exercise a species of
mock jurisdiction over their subjects which is much laughed at by the
whites; but their chief power and superiority over their countrymen is
shown on the day of the festival. The negroes of their nation, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
pay much respect to them. The man who had acted as their king in
Itamaraca (for each district has its king) for several years, was about
to resign from old age, and a new chief was to be chosen; he who
had been fixed upon for this purpose was an old man and a slave,
belonging to the plantation of Amparo. The former queen would
not resign, but still continued at her post. The old negro who was
this day to be crowned, came early in the morning to pay his respects
to the vicar, who said to him in a jocular manner, “Well, sir, so to-day
I am to wait upon you, and to be your chaplain.” About eleven
o’clock I proceeded to the church with the vicar. We were standing
at the door, when there appeared a number of male and female
negroes, habited in cotton dresses of colours and of white, with flags
flying and drums beating; and as they approached we discovered
among them the king and queen, and the secretary of state. Each of
the former wore upon their heads a crown, which was partly covered
with gilt paper, and painted of various colours. The king was dressed
in an old fashioned suit of divers tints, green, red, and yellow; coat,
waistcoat, and breeches; his sceptre was in his hand, which was of
wood, and finely gilt. The queen was in a blue silk gown, also of
ancient make; and the wretched secretary had to boast of as many
colours as his master, but his dress had evident appearances of each
portion having been borrowed from a different quarter, for some parts
were too tight and others too wide for him.</p>

<p>The expence of the church service was to be provided for by
the negroes; and there stood in the body of the church a small table,
at which sat the treasurer of this black fraternity, (<i>irmandade</i>) and
some other officers, and upon it stood a box to receive the money.
This was produced but slowly, much too slowly for the appetite of
the vicar, who had not breakfasted, though it was now nearly mid-day,
for he and his assistant priests were to chaunt high Mass. Therefore
he approached the table, and began to expostulate with these
directors, declaring that he would not go to the altar until every
expence was paid. I was much amused to see him surrounded
by the blacks, and abusing them for their want of punctuality<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
in their contributions. There was soon an uproar in the church
among the negroes; the vicar had blamed some of them, and now
when he left them to themselves, they called each other to an account,
and the consequences were, that many high and angry words
passed between them in the church. It was a most entertaining
scene to me and a few other persons, who stood by and heard what
was going on. However, at last Their Majesties knelt down at the
railing of the principal chapel, and the service commenced. As soon
as this was over, the new king was to be installed; but as the vicar
was hungry, he dispatched the matter without much ceremony; he
asked for the crown, then went to the church-door,&mdash;the new sovereign
presented himself, and was requested or rather desired to kneel
down; the insignia were given to him, and the vicar then said,
“Now, sir king, go about thy business.”<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a></p>

<p>As the king belonged to Amparo, the eating, drinking, and dancing
were to be at that place; consequently, in a short time our town remained
quite quiet, and I little thought that I should so soon be disturbed. About
four o’clock in the afternoon, Francisco, one of my negroes, came
running from Amparo, and he said that the people at that place were
killing Manoel, who was fighting against a number of persons, by
whom he had been attacked. I mounted my horse, and proceeded
to the plantation with all possible haste. I found Manoel tied to the
middle of a long cord, of each end of which one man had hold, and
these persons were standing in opposite directions for the purpose of
keeping the negro at a distance from any one. His face was covered
with blood, and his cloaths were much torn. I rode up to him, and
spoke to him; he turned round, as if to strike me; but when he discovered
who it was, he cried out, “It is my master, and now I care
for no one;” and then he again proceeded in his abuse towards those
who had maltreated him. Francisco soon arrived, and I sent Manoel
home with him. The overseer of the plantation (for the owner was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
not at home) chose to take umbrage at some of my people who now
arrived, because they were armed. I told him that they were perfectly
right in coming prepared for the worst, but that I felt quite
confident that not one person present would think of insulting me or
any other white man; and therefore I sent my people away; he said
that I judged correctly of his feelings, and some others stepped
forwards to confirm the words of the overseer. The negro who had
acted improperly, had been provoked so to do by the behaviour of
some of the free persons towards him; but the affair would not have
occurred, if the overseer had done his duty, or if any man of weight
and importance had been present.</p>

<p>About this time I agreed to take a cottage with a small piece of
land attached to it, in the neighbourhood of Conception. It was
situated upon a shelf of the hill, immediately below the town, and
opposite to the village of Camboa. The break in the hill had only
space sufficient to admit of the cottage in breadth, so that on either
side it must be reached by an ascent or descent. The view from it
differed little from that which was to be obtained from the town-hall;
save that now to the left, the town and the church were to be seen
half concealed among the banana plants and trees. All the
lands in this neighbourhood were subdivided among persons of several
casts. That which immediately joined mine on two sides belonged
to the vicar, and on the third side it was inclosed by the channel,
whilst on the fourth, a numerous family of free negroes possessed a
small spot covered with coco-trees. These latter people had been
much impoverished by the obstinacy of the chief of the family, now
deceased, in maintaining a law-suit for many years, about the boundaries
of his plot of land. As soon as I took possession, one of his
sons wished to commence law proceedings with me, in spite of several
awards which had been given against his father. I began to make a
fence around the piece of land which I had taken, and he immediately
did all in his power to prevent me from accomplishing my object;
however, as he saw that whatever he said was of no avail, he set off
to Goiana to seek redress by law. This I discovered accidentally in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
the evening. In the morning at four o’clock I mounted on horseback,
and followed him to Goiana, accompanied by Fideles, a creole
negro, in the place of Manoel who was disabled for some time by
the occurrence which has been related.</p>

<p>I proceeded through the plantation of Amparo, and reached the
spot at which passengers embark in the canoe that plies between
the island and the main land. The tide was out, and we entered
among the mangroves, through which a path has been made in the
mud; it is dangerous to allow the horse to step out of this, as the
slime is deep on either side. We stood at the water’s edge, just beyond
the mangroves, and hailed the ferryman, until he shoved off and
came towards the island. The mosquitos persecuted us unmercifully,
during this delay, and it was with difficulty we prevented our horses
from treading out of the path. The channel is here much broader
than near to Conception; but there is a bank near to the centre of
it, upon which, when the tide is out, the horses regain their
footing; but still the passage is distressing to the beasts; however we
reached the opposite bank in safety<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a>. Here stands the village of
Itapisuma, which consists of a long street, situated near to the water’s
edge, and running parallel with the channel; it is composed of small
low houses. A narrow path took us to the village of Pasmado, a
distance of two leagues, where we entered the great cattle road; we
crossed the river of Araripe, passed through the village of Bû, and
about mid-day stopped at the hamlet of Fontâìnhas. Here I put up
at a cottage, and on enquiry found that there was some dried meat
to be sold at a neighbouring hut; some of this was purchased, and
was cooked for me by the good woman of the cottage.</p>

<p>The people of Pasmado are famous for their proficiency in the
working of iron. The knives which are made at that place are in
great request all over the country, and although these are a prohibited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
article, as I have before mentioned, still they are made publicly
at Pasmado, and indeed at many other places in the country.</p>

<p>Whilst I was at Fontâìnhas, three armed men came to the door
with a fourth person whom they had taken into custody, under a
suspicion of his being a horse-stealer. It was proved that he had
been seen in company with a man of this description, but he made
it appear that he had been hired by him to assist in conducting some
horses, without his having any knowledge of their being obtained irregularly,
and therefore they set him at liberty. During the whole of
my stay in Pernambuco, I only heard of two or three instances of
houses being broken open, and scarcely of any murders that were
not occasioned by quarrels, or had been committed in revenge; but
cattle-stealing is common. I was in the constant habit of hearing
of thefts of this description<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a>. In the afternoon I reached Goiana,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
and on the following day presented my papers to the <i>Juiz de Fora</i>.
As soon as I had accomplished the end for which I came, I returned
to Itamaraca. Whilst I was at Goiana, an English merchant vessel,
called the Elizabeth, had been on shore upon the south sand-bank
of the harbour of Itamaraca. She had been chased by an English
ship of war, under the supposition that she was an American, and
the merchant vessel was also acting under the same idea regarding
the pursuer. The master made for the harbour of Itamaraca and ran
the vessel ashore; and the mistake under which both of them had
been acting was not cleared up until the ship of war sent a boat on
board. She floated at the height of the tide, and proceeded to Recife
without much damage. Many of the people of Itamaraca put
off in their <i>jangadas</i>, for the purpose of rendering every assistance in
their power, and were very indignant at the crew refusing to admit
any of them on board. This, I suppose, proceeded from the fear of
being plundered, and of salvage being claimed, as occurs frequently
upon the coast of Ireland in cases of distress. But far from any mischief
being intended, I am confident that a mere trifle (a few gallons
of rum for instance) would have satisfied those who went to offer to
assist.</p>

<p>After my removal in April to the Toque, for so my new dwelling
was called, I led a life of quietude; and to one who has not known
other countries, and does not feel that a residence in Brazil is a
species of banishment, it would be a life of great happiness. I
went out young, and therefore had few unpleasant feelings of
this kind to conquer, but when I reflect upon the line of life in
which I had taken my station I am happy that I was removed. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
climate, in particular, fascinates every one; the heat is scarcely ever
disagreeable, and the power of the sun is rendered less perceptible
by the freshness of the sea breeze; the coolness of the night too removes
all lassitude, if any should have been felt. I have often sat
at my door when the moon has been so clear as to render reading by
her light, though somewhat irksome, still not difficult. When the
night has been dark, I have watched the lights which were to be seen
upon the sand-banks, that proceed from the land on each side of the
entrance of the harbour; they were frequented at low water by numbers
of persons in search of shell-fish. The appearance was singular,
for the lights seemed to float upon the water.</p>

<p>The house in which I now dwelt was a long low building, situated,
as I have before observed, upon a narrow break in a steep hill; it was
constructed of timber and mud, and the eaves of the cottage were
on one side about five feet from the ground, and on the other they
were only three feet. The door and window were in the gable-end,
and fronted the sea. The principal apartment was furnished with a
few chairs, and a table, a trunk containing my books, and also a large
chest, in which were deposited the <i>farinha</i> and the beans for the
weekly consumption of the establishment; in one corner likewise
stood a large jar of water, and upon a peg immediately above the
jar was hung the usual ladle of the country;&mdash;this is formed of the half
of the inner shell of a coco-nut, and has a long wooden handle fixed to
it; some rich persons make use of silver <i>cocos</i>, as these ladles are
called. The room which I have attempted to describe, two cabins
or very small bed-chambers, and a kitchen included the whole building.
At one side were erected a stable and two apartments, which
remained unfinished when I came away. Behind the cottage was the
shed which covered the apparatus for making the <i>farinha</i>; and yet
farther back, in the same direction, the negroes had formed their
huts of mud and coco leaves. I was now still nearer to the channel,
and so immediately above it as to see every canoe or raft which passed
to and fro. The land about the house was covered with brushwood
and tall coco-trees, and there were likewise a few Acaju trees. However<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
the small wood was soon cleared away, and the view on every
side remained unobstructed.</p>

<p>The first business of the morning was to see that the people went
out to work at the proper time; then the stable and other matters of
the same kind were to be attended to; for in every thing which is to
be done by slaves the master or his deputy must keep his eye as
much upon what is going forwards as possible. After this I breakfasted,
and then either read or wrote, or mounted my horse and rode
to the spot upon which my people were at work. I dined about
two o’clock, and afterwards sat in my hammock smoking; any of the
secondary people, or of those in the lower ranks of life, would sometimes
about three or four o’clock come to speak to me upon business,
or to ask or communicate news, and so forth. Soon after
four o’clock, I usually rode out again to see the work, and returned
about five or half past. The remainder of the day-light was often
expended in reading, and at times the vicar or some one else would
come and sit with me until seven o’clock. Sun-set in retired situations
usually produces melancholy feelings, and not less unpleasant
was this period under the circumstances in which I was placed.
The negroes were coming home straggling from their work, fatigued
and dirty; the church-bell tolled dismally at intervals, that all Catholics
should count their beads; the sea looked black, and the foliage
of the trees became rapidly darker and darker as the sun sank
behind the hills. There is scarcely any twilight in those regions;
the light is in a few minutes changed into darkness, unless the moon
has risen. Her light is not afforded gradually, but her power is
perceived very shortly after the setting of the sun. In the evening
I sat and smoked in the open air, and if it was at the time of
spring tides, I had a fire made to windward, on account of the mosquitos,
and of a very diminutive species of black fly, which is called
<i>maroìm</i>, and of which the bite is as painful as that of the mosquito;
this last species of insect is there called <i>morisoca</i>. The <i>maroim</i> is
usually to be seen near to mangroves. If these tormentors were too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
troublesome to be endured, or if I was so inclined, I would close
my door and window, and read or write until ten or eleven o’clock,
and then go to bed; but frequently I would lie down in my hammock,
and rest in it unintentionally during the greater part of the
night.</p>

<p>My time passed less pleasantly during the months of June and
July, owing to the rain, and to the removal of the vicar to Recife
during that period.</p>

<p>Through his persuasion, and from the gradual general disposition
of the feelings of the people in favour of the measure, two boys,
resident at Conception, were sent to Recife for the purpose of being
inoculated with the cow-pox; as soon as they returned, the surgeon
of Iguaraçu, a young man of considerable merit who had been educated
at Lisbon, came over to the island to inoculate any persons who
might be inclined to undergo the operation. Among the children
it was almost general. Their parents and friends were told that the
disorder was not infectious, and consequently no precautions were
taken in separating those who were under its influence from the other
inmates of the same cottage. Soon afterwards an elderly woman, the
attendant of a child who had been inoculated, fell sick and died,
and other persons were likewise afflicted with the same disorder.
The infection spread, and ten or twelve persons died of it in the
island. The evil indeed was only stopped by the inoculation of
great numbers of the inhabitants. It was observed that none of the
individuals who had been inoculated had been in danger, and therefore
it was soon seen that the wisest plan was to undergo the operation.
A few however were so much alarmed at the fate of some of
their acquaintances, that they lived for many days in the woods,
scarcely visiting any habitation of man in the dread of infection. It
was proved that the small-pox did not exist at that time upon the
island, for every enquiry was made,&mdash;much pains were taken by
many persons of zeal and activity to certify that this was the case;
and indeed when that dreadful malady appears in any neighbourhood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
the whole country round is alarmed, and every precaution is
taken to prevent communication. Now, it was generally said that
either the boys who had been sent to Recife were inoculated with the
small-pox instead of the cow-pox, or that the cow-pox degenerated
and became an infectious disease. The boys received the matter
from a newly-imported negro, who had, it is true, been inoculated
with the cow-pox, but he might have had the small-pox upon him at
the time, though it had not made its appearance. It is from the
newly arrived Africans, that the small-pox is often spread abroad,
after the country has had a long respite from this much dreaded disorder.
One man who resided near to Conception caught the disease
and died; he had only sat for a short time in an outward room of a
house in the interior of which some children were confined who had
been inoculated.</p>

<p>The unfortunate result of this trial of the new disorder rivetted
many persons in their prejudices against it; and others who had strenuously
recommended its adoption began to stagger, and to fear that
they had been deceived; however, as none of those who were inoculated
had been in danger, the people did not appear to have taken a
thorough dislike to it. To me this was a most anxious time; my
establishment of slaves and free people consisted of twenty-five persons,
of whom scarcely any had had the small-pox. They were too
many to inoculate at once, and therefore I cut off all communication
with my neighbours. This was done without much difficulty; Manoel
was armed, and was ready to prevent any one from approaching
the place, and this I could do without injustice, for the path led only
to the house. I had several fierce dogs, which were all let loose on
this occasion, notice being given to the neighbourhood of such a
measure having been adopted.</p>

<p>Considerable zeal has been shewn by the supreme government of
Brazil in the introduction of the cow-pox into the country. An
establishment has been formed at Recife, consisting of a physician
and two surgeons for the inoculation, free of expence, of all persons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
who apply for this purpose. The inoculation is expressly
confined to the matter of the cow-pox. The establishment has not
however, yet fixed upon any settled plan for having a constant
supply of the matter, and therefore the medical men belonging
to it are often obliged to remain inactive for several weeks at a
time.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XIV.</h2>

<p class="pch">ANTS.&mdash;SNAKES, AND OTHER REPTILES.&mdash;RIVER OF IGUARAÇU.&mdash;BUILDING A
HOUSE.&mdash;SEVERAL SPECIES OF TIMBER TREES.&mdash;THE PINHAM, MUTAMBA,
AND GAMELEIRA TREES.&mdash;THE WHALE.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">I HAVE said that the lands of the Engenho Velho were much infested
by the red ants; but indeed scarcely any part of the island
of Itamaraca is free from these most noxious insects. They are of a
dusky red colour, and vary from one quarter of an inch to one inch in
length. Their bite is painful, and they will sometimes fix themselves
so firmly with their antennæ, as to leave the points of them in
the wound which they have made. Their food is entirely vegetable.
I found them extremely troublesome during the continuance
of the rains. They would often make their way between the bricks
of the floor of my house, and pick up any particles of flour or any
grains of maize which might chance to be strewed upon it. On one
occasion, two large bags of maize of equal size were placed in the
room at night; but in the morning one of them was considerably
lower than the other; for this I could not account until, on a nearer
examination, I saw one of the red ants coming out of a small hole
which there was at one side of the bag, with its load upon its back,
and soon another followed, and so forth. I now accidentally put my
hand upon the bag, and it fell still lower; so that an arch must have
been formed within, either by a very singular chance, or by the management
of these most extraordinary insects.</p>

<p>Upon another evening, they made their appearance in such great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
numbers as to darken the floor of the corner of the room from which
they proceeded. I sent for some dried leaves of the coco-tree, and
only got rid of the enemy by making in the house a bonfire upon
the spot of which they had taken possession. I had some pomegranate
trees at the back of the cottage, which I was preserving with
great care; and I had one evening particularly admired the beauty
of one of these plants, which was covered with red blossoms. In the
morning the flowers were still upon the tree, but scarcely any leaves
remained; these were upon the ground, and some of the destroyers
were cutting off the few which still were left, whilst their companions
were occupied below in conveying away the spoil. I could not
avoid watching them for some minutes, and admiring their ingenuity
and systematic manner of going to work; but soon I vowed vengeance
upon these enemies, and immediately commenced operations. There
was a steep bank a little below the cottage, which had every appearance
of harbouring these insects, for the red earth which lies at some
distance below the surface of the ground, was thrown up all around
it. I placed four negroes below the bank, to cut it away perpendicularly.
They had not worked long before the war commenced,
for a war it was when some of the nests were laid open. The ants
came out in great numbers, but torches of dried coco leaves were
ready and a large fire, and with these weapons we had much the advantage
of them. The bank contained a vast number of circular
holes of about six inches diameter, which were placed at unequal distances
from each other, and many of them were without subterraneous
communications from one to the other. Every one had a
passage to the surface of the ground, and some of them had more
than one leading upwards. These nests or holes contained a substance
of a grey colour, which bore the appearance of thick cobwebs
pressed closely together; and on being squeezed in the hand it had
a liquid feel, that is, the skin was moistened by it. When put into
water it swam upon the top. We had placed a large brass basin
upon the fire, and filled it with water for the purpose of putting
this substance into it. In some of the circular holes there were no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
ants, but others were crowded with them. Great numbers were
destroyed; and the cottage and its neighbourhood enjoyed for a short
time some respite, but another horde from a different quarter discovered
that the place was untenanted, and we were again persecuted.</p>

<p>There is another method of destroying the ants, which has only of
late years been introduced; but this is more particularly adapted to
their destruction when they are undermining a building. A mixture
of brimstone, and of any other substances which create a considerable
degree of smoke, is burnt at the entrance of the ant-hill, a
hole being in the first place dug around it, that the combustible
matter may be laid rather lower than the surface of the ground immediately
surrounding. Then a large pair of bellows is made use of
to blow the smoke down the aperture; now it is necessary to observe,
that all the crevices by which the smoke is again ejected,
should be stopped up. If the operation is conducted with due attention
it has been found successful. It is likewise a means of
discovering the several communications of the same ant-hill, and
thus being able with less uncertainty to judge of the situation of the
chief pot (<i>panella</i>) or nest.</p>

<p>The red ant is particularly destructive to the mandioc plant, and in
many parts it is almost impossible to preserve the plantations of it
from them<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a>. I recollect having planted a considerable quantity of
it in some low marshy ground, upon hillocks, and the land was so
moist that water remained in the furrows round the bottom of each
hillock, after the manner of dykes. On this account, I thought it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
superfluous to desire that any precautions should be taken against
the ants; however, I rode one afternoon to see the field, and was
surprised to find that the plants upon some of the hillocks were
deprived of their leaves. I knew by whom this must have been
done, but could not for some minutes discover how the insects had
been able to reach the mandioc. I soon saw an ant-track and a few
of the ants going along it; I followed the track, and observed that
they had formed a bridge of leaves across one of the furrows, upon
which they were going over. Some of them crossed to and from the
hillock, as I stood watching them.</p>

<p>There were several other species of ants of less bulk, which were
occasionally seen. The small red ant and the small black ant, both of
which feed on animal substances, would sometimes crowd around a fly,
a spider, a small lizard, or any other small animal or insect which might
lie dead upon the floor; and by degrees, a number sufficient to move
their prey would assemble, and they would convey it slowly along,
even up a white-washed wall, if the load was not heavier than usual.
It was a most unpleasant sight to watch these insects clinging to their
burthen on all sides of it, and so closely packed as to appear to be
one shapeless mass of moving substance. All species of ants have a
disagreeable smell; but the carnivorous small red ant is that which is
the most offensive. There is also another kind of small black ant;
it makes its nest in trees, and not near to and among the timbers of
houses. Though the size of this ant is very diminutive, being smaller
than any other species, it is a dreadful enemy to the large red ant, owing
to the numbers and determined courage of the black ant. These
small insects are sought after, and encouraged to build upon orange
and other fruit trees, which are liable to destruction from the large
red ant; and they effectually defend their appointed posts from the
dreaded invaders, if time has been given for their numbers to be
equal to the task. I have sometimes seen the entrance to the nest of
the red ants surrounded by the dead of both parties; but notwithstanding
that the number of black ants which are engaged is always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
much greater than that of the red ant, still I observed that the slain
of the latter always out-numbered the former.<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a></p>

<p>The house in which I resided at Jaguaribe, had been in former
times a barn in which the sugar was put into chests for exportation;
and I had heard from the neighbours that the ants about it
were numerous; and particularly a small black ant called the <i>formiga
douda</i>, or foolish ant, owing to its not appearing to have any track,
but to wander about the spot upon which the horde has appeared,
running fast to and fro, and irregularly. These are distinguished
from the black ant of the orange trees by this name of <i>douda</i>. One
evening I had been asleep in my hammock, and was not a little surprised
on waking, to see that part of the wall opposite to me, which
was white-washed, appeared to be covered with a piece of black
cloth; I got up, and approached it with the lamp in my hand. I soon
saw what it was, and could not help shuddering, for the sight, I may
say, was horrible; myriads of these ants were marching along
the wall, and their numbers were rapidly increasing. I had scarcely
recovered from the first surprise, when on looking round, I saw that
the other side of the room was in the same state; I left the place
quickly, and calling to some of the negroes, desired them to bring
coco and palm-leaves in abundance; this was done, and operations being
actively set on foot against them by applying lighted leaves to the walls,
we soon got rid of the major part of the ants; however many of them
escaped by retreating into the numerous cracks in the walls. The
next morning the walls were again white-washed, and as many of the
crevices filled up as possible. On another occasion, I was awakened in
bed in the middle of the night, by a sensation in my feet as if they had
been pricked gently by many pins. I jumped up, and as there was a light
in the room, I soon perceived what had caused the uneasy sensations;
several of these black ants were running about my legs, and upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
bed and floor they were every moment becoming more and more numerous.
I escaped, and as soon as the bed cloaths were removed the
scene of burning the host of enemies was re-acted.</p>

<p>There yet exists another description of ants, called the <i>tioca</i>; these
are black, and on the whole are even larger than the destructive red
ant; but I never saw the <i>tioca</i> in great numbers; and when I have
observed them, it has been near to where sugar is kept, running to
and fro without any settled path and seemingly without any plan of
operations. Their bite is still more painful than that of the red
ant.</p>

<p>The ants were not my only persecutors at Itamaraca, for these were
assisted by the <i>copim</i>, (<i>termes arborum</i>), who build their enormous
nests, called in Brazil <i>panellas</i> (pots) among the rafters of houses,
which they destroy in the course of time; and likewise they form
their settlements upon trees. They oftentimes made their covered
ways along the white-washed walls of my house, or up the door posts;
but I took every precaution against them, which was more particularly
necessary in this instance, as my dwelling was not built of the best kinds
of timber. I was advised to besmear the places in which they persisted
in attempting to build with treacle, and I found that this was successful
in making them alter their proceedings. It is well known in that
country by all those persons who have paid any attention to the subject,
that there are certain kinds of timber which are more liable to
be attacked by these insects than others. However, a person who
was about to build a house, chose to think that the distinction which
the carpenters made in the several kinds of timber which they recommended
him to obtain, either proceeded from some sinister views in
the men, or from prejudices which they had imbibed. Therefore,
contrary to the advice of his workmen and of his friends, he purchased
any kinds of timber which were presented to him for sale, not
attending to the quality but to the price. The house was built, and he
had already either removed to it or was upon the point of so doing,
when it was discovered that the <i>copim</i> had attacked some of the principal
timbers; and at last it was judged expedient to pull down a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
considerable part of the building, without which the whole would
have fallen a sacrifice to the insects. A solution of the substance
of which the nest of the <i>copim</i> is formed, is used as an injection by
the peasants in aguish disorders.<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a></p>

<p>I have not yet mentioned all the persecutors; for besides those
which have been here named, and the famous <i>chiguas</i>, of which I
have elsewhere spoken, there are the <i>moribondos</i>, a black insect,
resembling somewhat the large red and the <i>tioca</i> ant in shape; the
<i>moribondo</i> is supplied with wings, and has a most painful sting in the
tail. It forms its nest upon the trunks and branches of trees; and in
clearing lands, the negroes always proceed with much care, that
they may not be taken unawares by these insects; for on a nest being
disturbed, they fly out in great numbers; notwithstanding every precaution,
this will occasionally happen; and I have known a negro to
be unable to work for several days after he has been stung by them.
The parts which are affected swell and become inflamed, and the sufferer
experiences for a day or two the alternate sensations of violent cold
and burning heat, similar to the symptoms of aguish disorders. When
the negroes discover the nest without disturbing its inhabitants,
dried palm leaves are lighted, and the nest is destroyed by fire. The
insects are not often all killed, but those which escape appear to
be stupified by the fire and smoke, and do not leave the nest.
I have handled them when they have been in this state, for
they become harmless; however, after a short time, their activity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
returns. There are three species of <i>moribondo</i>; the black,
of which I have treated; the white, which are so called, although
they are only partially white; and the <i>moribondo formiga</i>, which are
distinguished from the black <i>moribondo</i>, in bearing a still greater resemblance
to the large black ant.</p>

<p>The bats also failed not here to annoy me, for they persecuted my
horses. They fasten upon the ears of the beasts, or upon their
backs, if there is any spot from which the skin has been rubbed.
I have in travelling sometimes been made particularly uneasy at
their attacks upon the horses; for unless we had some animals above
the requisite complement, it was necessary to load them with the
wound open. The skin of an owl is often hung up in a stable for
the purpose of scaring the bats.</p>

<p>In laying open the ant-hill which I have above-mentioned, we
discovered a couple of the <i>cobras de duas cabeças</i>, or two-headed
snakes or worms; each of them was rolled up in one of the nests.
These snakes are about eighteen inches in length, and about the
thickness of the little finger of a child of four or five years of age.
Both extremities of the snake appear to be exactly similar to each
other; and when the reptile is touched, both of these are raised, and
form a circle or hoop to strike that which has molested it. They
appear to be perfectly blind, for they never alter their course to avoid
any object until they come in contact with it, and then without
turning about they crawl away in an opposite direction. The colour is
grey inclining to white, and they are said to be venomous. This
species of snake is often found in ant-hills, and I have likewise killed
them in my house; they frequent dung-hills and places in which
vegetable matter has been allowed to remain for a length of time unremoved.</p>

<p>The island of Itamaraca is said to be less infested with snakes than
the main land, and perhaps this opinion is founded on experience;
but some of those which are generally accounted venomous certainly
exist upon it. A rattle-snake was killed at Amparo two years
previous to the period of which I am speaking. A horse died one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
night in my neighbourhood, and his death was attributed to the bite
of a snake; there was a wound upon him, and his body was much
swoln. Manoel killed a <i>cobra de veado</i>, or antelope snake (<i>Boa
Constrictor</i>) which he brought home to shew me. It was a young
one, of seven feet in length, and about the thickness of a man’s arm.
The name which it bears of antelope snake proceeds from the
destruction which it causes among these animals. The full-grown
snake of this species lies in wait for the antelope and other animals
of the same size; it entwines its tail around a tree, and patiently expects
that its prey will pass within its reach; when this occurs, it
encircles the unfortunate animal with its enormous body, thus securing
it. I never could discover, after much enquiry, that it had
ever been found in a torpid state, digesting its food. Men have
sometimes been caught by them; but if the person so situated can
draw his knife, his escape is very possible, though he will probably
receive several wounds. The opinion is general in the country that
the person who receives the bite of one of these snakes, has nothing
farther to fear from that of any other snake of whatever description.</p>

<p>One of the negroes whom I had hired with the plantation of
Jaguaribe, had one leg much thicker than the other. This was
occasioned, as he told me, by the bite of a rattle-snake; he said, that
he had been cured from the bites of snakes by a <i>Curador de cobras</i> or
<i>Mandingueiro</i>, and had therefore not died; but that “as the moon
was strong<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a>,” he had not escaped receiving some injury from the
bite. He had frequently violent pains in his limbs, at the full and
change of the moon particularly, and sometimes the wound opened,
and remained in this state for weeks together; but if he was careful
in not exposing it to the early dews of the morning, it would again
heal without any medicinal applications being made use of.</p>

<p>The most beautiful reptile which I saw was the <i>cobra de coral</i>, or
coral snake or worm. It is about two feet in length, and of the thickness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
of a man’s thumb; it is marked with black, white and red stripes
transversally. The general opinion is that it is venomous.<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a></p>

<p>But the snakes do not cause so much annoyance as the smaller
species of vermin which I am about to mention; because the former
seldom enter the houses, nor are they very frequently to be seen in
the paths or roads. But the <i>aranha caranguejeira</i>, or crab-spider,
(<i>aranea avicularia</i>); the <i>lacraia</i> or scorpion, and the <i>piolho de cobra</i>,
or snake louse, (<i>scolopendra morsitans</i>), are to be met with in the
houses and in all situations. They should be carefully avoided, for
their bites are painful, and are said to cause inflammation. An instinctive
recollection of the chance of meeting with these or other
vermin of less importance became so habitual with me (and indeed is
so with most persons) that when I was about to begin to read, I
closed the book in the first place violently so as to crush any thing
that might have crept in between the leaves; when my hat, or boots,
or cloaths were put on, some precaution was taken, as a thing of
course; this was not done from a direct idea of the likelihood of
finding any thing unpleasant in that immediate instance; but the precaution
was entered into from habit, unconsciously. I was one day
bit by a <i>lacraia</i>; I had mounted my horse, and had taken my umbrella
in my hand for the purpose of shading me from the sun when
I had advanced farther upon my ride; when I was in the act of opening
it, I felt suddenly a violent pain upon the fleshy part of the inside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
of one of my hands; on looking down I soon saw what it was that had
bitten me, upon which I turned back, and rode home. I applied the
juice of lemons to the part, and in about half an hour, not finding any
particularly disagreeable sensations, again mounted my horse. The
only effect which I experienced from the bite was a numbness in my
hand for the remainder of the day, and a redness about the point
which was immediately affected; but on the following day the former
was removed, and the latter did not last long. Labat mentions an instance
in which the bite of a scorpion caused as little inconvenience
as that which I have related. When I mentioned to some of my
neighbours the slight consequences of the bite, they ascribed it to the
state of the moon.</p>

<p>In the month of September, I went up the river in a canoe to Iguaraçu.
The distance from my residence was two leagues. The river
or creek has two mouths, which are situated in the bay of the village
of Camboa, which is immediately opposite to Conception. In the
river there are several islands which are covered with mangroves, and
are too low to be cultivated; the banks of the river are likewise lined
with the same description of plant, excepting at one point to the
left in going up, where the bank is high and perpendicular, and
projects considerably. At this place the forest trees come down to
the edge of the bank. Near to the town of Iguaraçu the mangroves
have been destroyed, and perhaps upon some particular spots they
did not originally grow. When the tide is out, the quantity of
water which remains in the river is trifling, and in some parts it is
nearly dry; indeed, were it not for two places of inconsiderable
breadth, where the water is always deep, a man on foot might walk
along its bed from about one mile above Camboa to the town. I
came down from Iguaraçu one day at the ebb of the tide in a small
canoe, which held one man besides myself; it was with difficulty that
he could find a channel in which there was sufficient water to float
our vessel. It was to Conception that the Portugueze came down
from Iguaraçu for provisions, during the siege of the latter place by
the savages in 1548, as is related by Hans Stade. I also observed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
one of the spots at which the savages attempted to sink the boat
as it returned, by means of letting a large tree fall upon it<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a>. The
town of Iguaraçu was plundered, and the inhabitants slaughtered by
the Dutch in 1632, under the direction of the dreadful mulatto
Calabar.<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a></p>

<p>The mangroves entirely destroy the beauty which it is natural to
suppose that the rivers of the country of which I am treating would
possess. Until they are destroyed a dull sameness presents itself,
for the eye cannot penetrate beyond them. Upon the banks of the
Capibaribe they have given place to houses and gardens, and the
alteration is most pleasing; upon the banks of the Maria Farinha,
the mangroves are beginning to give way to cultivation at the settlements
(<i>sitios</i>) of Jardim and Olaria; but the Iguaraçu is without
any break, and the Goiana is, I understand, in the same state. There
are plantations along these rivers, but the owners content themselves
with merely cutting a path through the mangroves down to the water’s
edge, so that to a stranger who goes up the rivers the country appears
to be uninhabited, until he passes some of these small openings,
at which a canoe or a <i>jangada</i> is moored; but the openings are
very narrow, and are only to be seen on coming immediately opposite
to them. The mangroves grow as far down as low water-mark,
and when the tide is out their entangled roots and sprouts, and their
stems covered with oysters and besmeared with mud, are left uncovered;
but at the height of the tide these are concealed, and the
water reaches up to the branches of the trees, so that those which
bend downwards are partly wetted, presenting to the beholder the
view of a forest growing in the water. This species of mangrove
sometimes attains the diameter of fifteen or eighteen inches, and the
height of twenty-five or thirty feet. There are two species with
which I am acquainted, the <i>mangue vermelho</i> or red mangrove, of
which I have been speaking, and the <i>mangue bravo</i> or wild mangrove.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
The bark of the former is used for tanning, and the timber is much
esteemed for beams and rafters in building, but it cannot be used as
posts, for under ground it decays very quickly; nor as railings, for it
does not bear exposure to the weather. A considerable trade is carried
on from Itamaraca, and from some other parts to Recife, in the
wood of these plants, which is used as fuel. The tree grows again
as often as it is cut down if the root is not injured, and with such rapidity
that the supply of the wood will, for a length of time&mdash;I mean
unless the destruction of the plant becomes more extensive than it is
at present&mdash;be fully adequate to the demand for it. The fish forsake
those parts to which the trees are brought to be cut up for firewood.
This may be judged to proceed from the properties of the bark. In
a fish-pen, (<i>cural de peixe</i>) near to my place no fish was caught after
the fuel-cutters had established themselves at the bridge hard by;
of this I heard much, as there was some squabbling upon the subject.
The ashes of the mangrove plants are used as <i>temper</i> in the
sugar boiling houses.<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span></p>

<p>As I did not, in 1814, suppose that on the following year I should
be recalled, I began to make some addition to my cottage, for it was
too small for me; and besides it was old, and was constructed of bad
timber, which caused it to be much infested by the ants and the
<i>copim</i>. I had a considerable quantity of timber of excellent quality
at Jaguaribe, which had been prepared by me for building there, and
therefore I determined to send for it. Permission was also obtained
from the owner of the Engenho Novo, to cut down some trees in his
woods, for which he ultimately refused to be paid. The woods of
his plantation came down nearly to the water’s edge near to Camboa,
and were consequently very conveniently situated for my purpose.
The building was to be constructed of wood and mud,&mdash;that is, of
thick posts supporting the roof and smaller posts at fixed distances
between the principal ones, and the openings between each of them
were to be filled up with mud. I could not help regretting that such
beautiful woods as those which were used should be employed in purposes
so much beneath their worth. The <i>pao ferro</i> or iron wood, which
is also called the <i>coraçam de negro</i> or the negro’s heart<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a>, was the most
valuable of those which I employed. The outward coat of the wood
of this tree is not particularly hard, but the heart destroys many
hatchets. I have seen some of this timber taken out of the ground
after standing for many years as a supporter to the roof of a house;
and though the outward coat was crumbling into dust, the black heart
seemed to be literally of iron, or to have increased rather than decreased
in hardness<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a>. This wood admits of considerable polish;
but the black wood, which is most esteemed for furniture, is the
<i>jacaranda</i>; this is also hard, but is much more penetrable than the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
<i>pao ferro</i>, and the polish to which it may be brought is more complete.<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a></p>

<p>The <i>pao d’arco</i> is another valuable wood, and is so called, I
imagine, from the use which the Indians made of it for their bows; it
is much used in building, and is accounted almost as durable as the
<i>pao ferro</i>. It admits of being cleft into splinters, which are flexible
without breaking. The <i>pao d’arco</i> has the property of retaining fire
for a long time without being stirred, and of yielding a bright light
if the log be occasionally touched. The peasantry take advantage of
this, and cleave the logs into several narrow splinters, of which they
form a bunch; this being lighted, serves them as a flambeau. Formerly,
likewise, when every thing was in a ruder state even than
it is now in Brazil, the sugar-works were lighted with logs of <i>pao
d’arco</i> instead of oil; indeed I have heard that some of the mills
in the back settlements still continue this practice. The ashes
of this tree are used as <i>temper</i> in the boiling houses of the
mills. The number of fine species of timber in Brazil is very great,
but I am myself acquainted only with a few of them.<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span></p>

<p>The <i>louro</i> is a large tree, and of it there are three species, all of
which are used principally for the beams of houses, for the timber of
them rots quickly under ground or if it be exposed to the weather. The
most esteemed timber for doors, window-shutters, floors of houses, &amp;c.
is the <i>pao amarello</i> or yellow wood. This is a large tree, and the
name which it has obtained, continues to be sufficiently appropriate
for the first six months after it has been cut down; but the yellow
colour is after this period lost, and the wood becomes of a dirty
brown. The canoes are almost exclusively made of the <i>pao amarello</i>.
The <i>pao santo</i> or holy-wood is scarce, and is much sought after for
certain purposes, as it is not liable to split, bend, or break; it is particularly
required for the teeth of the sugar-rollers. The wood is
beautifully veined with yellow and brown, but becomes after some
time of a dusky brown colour. There is likewise a tree which is
called <i>cedro</i>, but whether it is the cedar or not I cannot determine;
the wood is hard, and is much esteemed for building.<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a></p>

<p>I cut down all the mangroves which grew along the borders of my
piece of land, and likewise some other kinds of trees which grew just
beyond the reach of the salt-water; among these was the <i>aroeira</i>, a small
irregular tree, of which the wood is soft, and not even fit for timber;
the only use to which the plant is put, is, that as the leaves have an
aromatic smell, they are used in curing fish, to which they impart a
slight portion of their odour; they are placed upon the <i>girau</i> or
<i>boucan</i>, and the fish is laid upon them; fish is likewise packed in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
leaves of the <i>aroeira</i> when about to be sent to a distance<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a>. The
tree only grows in situations near to the sea. Good fences might be
made of it for the stakes take root; I used some of the trees for this
purpose. The <i>molungo</i> and the <i>pinham</i> have likewise this last property;
and as the former is supplied with strong sharp thorns, this
advantage renders it preferable to the <i>aroeira</i>. The <i>molungo</i> grows
spontaneously in moist situations, but the stakes take root even if the
soil is dry, unless no rain falls for some time after it has been planted.
Great numbers of the <i>molungo</i> grew near to my house, just below a
spring of water which oozed from the side of the hill. The cow-itch
was also found here in abundance; it is called by the peasants
<i>machonan</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>pinham</i> requires less rain and grows quicker than the <i>molungo</i>,
but it is without thorns, and the plant is not nearly so large. The
seed of the <i>pinham</i> is used as an emetic by the peasants, and is
violent in its operation, a very small quantity being sufficient even
for an adult. The fruit incloses three seeds, and is about the size
of the common hazel-nut. During the third attack of ague which
I had whilst I was at Jaguaribe, I placed myself under the direction of
an old mulatto woman, than whom I never saw any one more like a
witch; and indeed poor old Antonia had the reputation of being
somewhat of a <i>mandingueira</i>. However she gave me a dose of
<i>pinham</i>, which, I think, consisted of four seeds, but they were picked
out from a heap of others for their superior size. The dose acted
most violently and effectually produced vomiting, and although excessive
weakness followed the disorder was removed. I begged her to
give me a quantity equal to what she had administered, that I might
take it to Recife; this I shewed to a practitioner, who answered that
he should have imagined that such a dose would have killed any one;
but the old reputed sorceress knew full well, that a dangerous disease<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
requires to be severely attacked<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a>. After the ague left me, my nurse
would not be satisfied until she applied the bark of the <i>mutamba</i>
tree to my stomach; or rather the application was made just below
the ribs, which she said was to prevent <i>dureza</i>; this she described as
a hardness immediately under the lower rib of each side, which sometimes
was produced by the ague, and which, if precautions were not
taken in time ended in dropsy. I did not suffer her to continue the
<i>mutamba</i> for many days, for I found that I was well, and wanted no more
nostrums. The <i>mutamba</i> is a small tree, having a straight stem; it
grows to the height of eighteen or twenty feet, and to the diameter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
of twelve or eighteen inches. The bark is easily torn off, and is
extremely glutinous.</p>

<p>The <i>Gameleira preta</i> (black,) so called from the dark colour of its
bark, is a large tree which grows in low marshy grounds; the stem
contains a white juice, which is much sought for as a medicine in all
eruptive complaints and in dropsy; it is likewise given inwardly. The
juice is obtained by making an incision in the stem, and leaving a vessel
into which the liquid may drop. There is another species of the same
tree, which is distinguished by the name of white <i>gameleira</i>, and this
is useless.</p>

<p>I was obliged in September to forsake my house for three days from
a most unexpected cause. A whale was stranded upon one of the sand-banks
at the mouth of the harbour; this being the third time that the
inhabitants of Itamaraca had been favoured with visitors of this description.
<i>Jangadas</i> were sent out to it, and when the tide came in, it floated,
and was towed into the harbour, where the persons who were employed
in the business landed it, as near as they could at high water mark, in
front of and distant from my house about three hundred yards.
Many of my neighbours were occupied in making oil; for any one
who pleased was at liberty to take as much of the blubber as he could
make use of; and one man fairly got into the whale, and ladled out
the fat which was melted by the heat of the sun. When the people
left the carcase, either at mid-day or at night, it was attacked by
numerous flights of <i>urubus</i>, and was literally covered by them. The
trees round about the spot were occupied by these enormous birds, which
were waiting for an opportunity of satisfying their boundless appetites.
The <i>urubu</i> is nearly twice the size of the common crow of England;
it is quite black, excepting at the point of the beak, which is white,
as I have been told, but this I did not observe. Wherever there happens
to be the carcase of an animal, these birds assemble shortly after the
death of the beast, and they seem to arrive in greater or less numbers
according to the size of the carcase. The peasants tell many stories
about the king of the <i>urubus</i>, who has a tuft of red feathers upon his
head, but I never heard any coherent account of this sovereign.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span></p>

<p>The stench proceeding from the whale became in a few days so
intolerable as to render a removal necessary, and therefore I applied
to an old creole black, a carpenter, to allow me to reside in his cottage,
which was neat and clean. To this he agreed; whilst he went
to live with some of his friends.</p>

<p class="pch">RECRUITING.&mdash;IMAGES.&mdash;ANIMALS.&mdash;MARACAS.&mdash;APOLLINARIO, MANDINGA
AND POULTRY.&mdash;HIEROGLYPHICS.&mdash;FESTIVAL OF OUR LADY OF CONCEPTION.&mdash;FANDANGOS.&mdash;THE
FORT.&mdash;A CHRISTENING.&mdash;THE INTRUDO.&mdash;THE
AUTHOR LEAVES BRAZIL.</p>

<p class="drop-cap03">IN the months of August and September, I was fully employed in
planting cane. I hired a number of free labourers, and was under
the necessity in a great measure of attending to the work myself. Of
this I shall take another opportunity of speaking.</p>

<p>About this time were issued orders from the governor for recruiting
the regiments of the line. The men who are required are pressed
into the service. The orders were forwarded to the <i>Capitaens-mores</i>,
who again distributed them to the captains. The directions were on
this occasion, and indeed always are, that men of bad character between
the ages of sixteen and sixty shall be apprehended, and sent
to Recife for enlistment; and that every family containing two or
more unmarried sons shall give one for the service of the country.
But it is on these occasions that tyranny has its full sway, that caprice
and pique have their full vent; that the most shameful partiality prevails,
that the most intolerable oppression is experienced; in fact now
it is, that the whole country is seen in arms against itself, and that
every means of entrapping each other are used by the nearest neighbours.
It is one of those impolitic arrangements which are sometimes
practised by governments without perceiving their pernicious
effects, and by which, as in the present case, the bad qualities of mankind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
are drawn forth, instead of every thing being done for their correction.
Revenge, violence, deceit, and breach of trust are excited,
and instead of suppression, they meet with encouragement.</p>

<p>The mildness of the provincial government of Pernambuco, under
the present Captain-general, is in none of its proceedings more apparent
than in this. Although this nobleman has for so many years
held the situation of chief of the province, now for the first time were
issued the orders for recruiting; but not until they had become absolutely
necessary from the state of the regiments. And even now,
the directions of the governor to the officers who were to execute his
commands were dictated in the spirit of gentleness;&mdash;if this word
may be used when despotism sends forth such mandates as these.
The official letter recommended impartiality, and threatened punishment,
in case wounds were inflicted without the most evident necessity.
But many were the instances of injustice which were committed,
and could not reach his knowledge. Petitions were sometimes
made to the governor, in particular instances of injustice, but
these were often of no avail, for the custom is, that the recruits should
be returned as being fit for service as soon as possible after their
arrival at Recife, and their names placed upon the rolls, from which
none can be removed without an order from the sovereign, although
the provincial governor should be aware of the true state of the
case.</p>

<p>A young man of respectability was carried before a certain <i>capitam-mor</i>,
and the alternative was proposed to him either to marry a young
woman, whom he had never seen, but who happened to be a burthen
to those persons under whose care she was placed, or to become
a soldier;&mdash;he of course preferred the latter, was sent to
Recife and was obliged to enlist. I heard of many instances of
young men being pressed into the service, upon whose exertions depended
the support of their parents; and of others whose lives were
spent in idleness, but to whom the protection of the captain was extended;
and some of these were unlawfully employed in apprehending
others. I was in the daily habit of seeing a young man who led an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
idle life and who had no duties to perform, lying in wait for some of
his former companions, that he might give notice to the captain of
the place of their concealment.</p>

<p>For some weeks the whole country appeared to be afflicted with a
civil war; parties of armed men were to be seen in all directions,
in search of those who had concealed themselves. An individual
who was not well known could not stir from his home without a pass
from the captain of the district in which he resided, stating him
to be a married man, or naming some other cause of exemption.
Nor is a man who is liable to be pressed, safe in his own house, for
the <i>tropa</i> or troop would surround the cottage in which any of these
persons were suspected to have taken refuge, and they would demand
admittance; and if this was denied, no scruple would be entertained
of breaking down the door, and entering by force; this occurred
to my knowledge in many cases, in several parts of the
country. Married men ought to be exclusively employed in the
apprehension of those who are liable to be pressed. Militia-men are
free from acting as oppressors and from being hunted down; unless
the governor applies to the colonels of the regiment to which they
belong. It is among the <i>Ordenanças</i> that the recruiting of which I
am treating is carried on. Negroes and Indians are excluded from
the regiments of the line; the former on the score of colour, and
the latter from their cast; white men and mulattos of all shades
being alone admitted. The great repugnance which is generally
felt towards the service is occasioned by the smallness of the pay, and
by the want of proper cloathing, whilst the almost incessant duty precludes
any hope of working at a trade, or of pursuing any employment
that is not connected with the life of a soldier. Several elderly
persons told me, that in former times the service was arranged in
a manner totally different; that then no difficulty was found in
obtaining the number of men required, but rather, that interest was
made for the situation of a soldier of the line. Each of the forts upon
the coast was garrisoned from the inhabitants of the neighbourhood
to a certain number; these enlisted as soldiers of the line, were embodied,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
and performed the duty of the forts, receiving the usual pay;
but they were not liable to removal to any other post; and from
their numbers the duty was easy, by which means they were enabled
to have around them their wives and families, and to follow any
trade to which they might have been brought up. Thus these men
had something for which to fight, if the service required that they
should act against any enemy of the State; they had homes to defend,
they had comforts of which they might be deprived, they had
ties which produced local attachments; but the regiments of the
present day are filled up with vagabonds and unmarried men, who
could not be expected to fight with the same ardour as those who had
to provide for the safety of their families; and these unsettled men
might perhaps follow him who gave the highest wages.</p>

<p>The soldier of South America ought to be a being of far different
stamp from the professed soldier of Europe. Any war which it
might be necessary for Brazil to wage against a foreign invader
should (indeed must) be carried on with a direct view to the peculiar
advantages of the country; it would be a <i>guerilla</i> war, a war under
the cover of woods and hills. Therefore, although it may be as well
to have a few disciplined soldiers who may be preserved, for the purpose
of forming the basis of a large force, if circumstances should
require it, still it is not by discipline that success will be ensured; it
is through the affection which the soldiers feel for their government
and for their country, that the result will be propitious or the contrary.
But the limited population will not allow of considerable
numbers of men (comparatively speaking) being cooped up uselessly
in forts, without being of any service to the State, whilst the lands are
covered with woods, and indeed whilst every branch of industry is
requiring additional hands. Besides if you train a large force to
military service, who by being so taught become superior to their
countrymen, and yet form it of the worst of men; if you bring them
up without any affection to the government, and without any hold
upon the rest of the inhabitants, excepting that of being able to injure
them; the likelihood is, that when you require their aid, they will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
found wanting, and perhaps for higher pay may act against those
whom they were expected to defend. If the soldier and the peasant
can be combined usefully in the same person, it is in Brazil that such
a system should be followed.</p>

<p>The foundation of a church which was commenced at the expence
of the <i>pês de castello</i>, as the fixed soldiers were called, are to be seen
near to the town of Conception. The building was given up when
the order arrived from the supreme government then at Lisbon, directing
this change of system.</p>

<p>During the recruiting I went to Recife, and in going along by the
sea shore, saw at several cottages parties of armed men, who were
waiting to see if they could entrap any one who might be liable to
be pressed. At the ferry of Maria Farinha there was a large company,
which was stationed there. I happened to be obliged to wait during a
shower of rain at a cottage in which some of these fellows were watching
for their prey. They were talking in high glee of the stratagems
which they had made use of to entrap several recruits, and of the blows
which they had been obliged to give to make some of them surrender.
The men who were stationed here received no pay, and yet they were
poor. They would probably have been quietly at their work at home,
without the thoughts of violence or barbarity which they now
entertained, if the perverse institutions of their country did not
bring them forward and teach them to be ruffians, at first lawfully;
but bad habits are not easily conquered, and the chance is, or
rather there is a certainty, that most of those who had been so employed
were rendered worse subjects than they had been before.
The track of coast between the main land opposite to Conception
and the Rio Doce is within one district, and it was upon this part of
the road that the chief disturbance seemed to be going on. The
<i>capitam-mor</i> had taken it for granted that no one would give his
children for the service, and therefore had, without asking, immediately
commenced operations of violence, taking the people
unawares, that as many recruits as possible might be obtained, and
his zeal in the service made manifest. From the Doce to Olinda, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
coast is in the district of Olinda, and here all was quiet; the <i>capitam-mor</i>
had followed the orders of the governor strictly, and things were
as regularly conducted as the system would allow. These facts are
mentioned to shew, that the performance even of the orders of the
provincial governor who resides within a few leagues, depends upon
the individual character of the person to whom they are forwarded.
God grant that I may soon see such a system altered,&mdash;that the eyes
of those who have the power of effecting this alteration may be
opened, for their own good as well as for that of the people over whom
they rule.</p>

<p>The river Maria Farinha is that which runs up to Jaguaribe;
its mouth is wide, and the bar will admit of craft of some size; but
the port cannot be considered as being worthy of attention. The
horses swim across, but the passage is distressing to them, for the tide
runs rapidly. In my way to Recife along the beach, I passed the fort
of Pao Amarello, distant from that place four leagues. It is small
and built of stone. The garrison is little more than nominal, but it
affords a comfortable residence for a captain of the Olinda regiment.
The port opposite to which the fort is situated, is nothing more than
a slight curve which the coast makes at this spot, by which vessels at
anchor can scarcely be said to receive any shelter; but the landing-place
is good. Wardenburg, the commander of the Dutch forces
which invaded Pernambuco in 1630, landed at Pao Amarello.<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a></p>

<p>I was in the habit of conversing with several of the people of
colour who resided in my neighbourhood. One man particularly
amused me much; he was a short and stout creole black, and a shoemaker
by trade. I was greatly entertained with his pompous
manner, exalting in terms of extravagant praise the advantages which
Itamaraca enjoyed, and the excellencies of Conception which was
his native spot, in particular. He lamented much the removal of
the mayor and chamber to Goiana, giving me to understand that
undue influence had been employed; forgetful of the insignificance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
of one place and the importance of the other. He also told me with
much vehemence of voice and action, that the late vicar had wished
to remove the image of our Lady of Conception from the parish
church to Pillar; but that the inhabitants assembled, and prevented
the accomplishment of the plan. “No,” he said, “if that image was to
leave us, we should consider ourselves unprotected, and then indeed
would our town be utterly destroyed.” The vicar of whom the man
spoke, might have gone to reside at Pillar if he pleased, but <i>he</i> too
had his prejudices in favour of the image, and did not like to say
Mass before any other in his own parish. Thus images cease to be
regarded as the representations of those to whom prayer is to be
addressed; a value is placed upon the wood itself, and religion degenerates
into unveiled idolatry.<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a></p>

<p>Another instance of the same description of feeling occurred at
Pillar. Our Lady under that invocation was represented by a small
image, which from age had become very dirty. A priest who used to
officiate at the chapel of the village in question, preferred purchasing
a larger image in the place of directing that the old one should be
painted afresh; he did so, and quietly removing the old image to a
house in the neighbourhood, placed the new Lady upon the altar in
its stead; but lo! many of the inhabitants would not hear mass
when they perceived the change that had been made; however the
priest went through the service, and then returned to his own residence,
which was at some distance. The people discovered that the
image still remained in their neighbourhood, and presently the house<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
in which it was concealed became known. The owner sent for the
priest, being afraid that some disagreeable consequences to himself
might ensue. The priest came, and without ceremony wrapped up Our
Lady in a handkerchief, and rode off with her to his own house,
from whence she was transferred to one of the side altars of the parish
church. Even at the time of which I am treating, some of the inhabitants
came to say their prayers before this image, unmindful of
the inconvenience of the distance.<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a></p>

<p>The sexton of the parish church, who was a mulatto man, had much
peculiarity of character. He had a great deal of penetration, but was
extremely cautious in what he said; and when questions were asked
relating to any affair in which he thought he might become implicated;
he usually answered&mdash;“where white men are concerned, negroes
must be silent<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a>.” This fellow was once holding a candle in the
hand of a dying person, and repeating the word “Jesus,” as is customary;
the patient began to move restlessly, but Gonsalo quietly
went on with his dismal work, and added with perfect unconcern&mdash;“Come
die, and have done with your nonsense.”<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a></p>

<p>The creole negro of whom I have above spoken, was fond of
shooting the larger kinds of game, such as antelopes, which are called
in the country <i>veados</i>, and <i>pacas</i> (<i>cavia paca</i>). This was done in the
following manner. A platform of thick twigs was made among the
branches of a tree, at the height of several feet from the ground, near
to some one of those plants upon whose leaves or fruit these animals
feed. At night two men placed themselves upon this platform, and
when the footsteps of the animal were heard, one of the men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
would light a small taper prepared for the occasion, and the other,
with his gun ready, looked round for the game. The animal was
allowed to come as near as it seemed inclined to do unmolested, and
was then fired at. The men immediately descended, and oftentimes
did not attempt to find their prey until the morning; returning to the
spot for the purpose. This is the usual manner of obtaining these
animals. The <i>tatu verdadeiro</i> or legitimate armadillo, was also
sometimes caught by him. I requested him to obtain for me a
<i>tamanduà</i>, which is a small species of ant-eater; he brought me one of
which the body was about six inches in length, and the tail about twelve;
and the hair of its skin was extremely soft; the animal was clinging
closely to the bough of a tree, and its tail also was entwining
the branch. My black friend, the shoemaker, told me that he had
been ordered to eat the flesh of the <i>tamanduà</i> after having had an
eruptive complaint, and that it was very beneficial for persons who
were recovering from the <i>bobas</i> or yaws. He said that it had “a taste
which was like unto the smell of the ants.” The sloth was to be
seen here occasionally; also the <i>cotia</i> (<i>cavia caudata</i>). The <i>porco da
India</i>, the guinea-pig, I have only seen in a tame state. At Jaguaribe,
the <i>capivara</i> (<i>cavia capybara</i>) was often seen among the mangroves;
the Indians sometimes eat it, but few of the negroes will.
There is also another mangrove animal, which is called in that country
<i>guachinim</i>; it feeds on crabs, and from what I could hear, has
much resemblance to a cat, but the tail is much longer; however I
never saw it. Neither did I see the <i>lontra</i> or sea-otter, but the skins
of this animal are much valued for saddle cloths, bearing a higher
price even than the skin of the jaguar.</p>

<p>I heard accidentally, in conversing with persons of the lower
ranks in life, of an instance in which the Indians continued their
heathenish customs. A family resided at a plantation in this neighbourhood,
which had much intimacy with many Indians, but none
of the members of it were of that cast. When the heads of the
families were from home, the young females were in the habit of
meeting to amuse themselves. On one of these occasions, an Indian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
girl carried one of her companions into the hut in which she and her
parents dwelt, and on this playmate questioning her, from girlish
curiosity, about several gourds which were hanging up in the room,
she appeared much alarmed and said, “You must not look that way,
those are <i>maracàs</i>, which my father and mother generally put into
their chest, but they have to-day forgotten them.” Notwithstanding
her entreaties to the contrary, her companion took hold of one of the
gourds, and moving it quickly discovered that there were pebbles
within; they had handles to them, and tufts of hair upon the top,
and they were cut and carved in divers unusual forms. Here this
matter ended, but soon afterwards several of the mulatto women
agreed to watch the Indians, for they knew that they often danced
in their huts with closed doors; this was an uncommon practice and
inconvenient too, for the open air is much pleasanter. They had soon
an opportunity of witnessing one of these meetings. The huts are
constructed of coco-leaves, and through these they managed to obtain
a view of what was going forwards. There was a large earthen pot
in the centre; and round this, both men and women were dancing.
A pipe was handed occasionally from one to the other. Soon afterwards,
one of the Indian girls told one of her companions of a different
cast from her own, as a great secret, that she had been sent
to sleep at a neighbour’s hut a few nights before, because her father
and mother were going to drink <i>jurema</i>. This beverage is obtained
from a common herb; but I never could persuade any of the
Indians to point it out to me; though when they positively asserted
that they were unacquainted with it, their countenances belied their
words.</p>

<p>I had a visit in October from a strange old man, whose age
was generally supposed to border upon ninety years. He was a
creole black, and had been a slave upon the plantation of Santos
Cosmo e Damiam in the Varzea to the southward of Recife; he
had settled at Iguaraçu, after he obtained his manumission, having
married when he was about seventy years of age, a young woman of
his own colour; and he was now surrounded by a young family. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
man did not reckon his age by years, but by the governors; and as
each of these, with few exceptions, remained at the head of the province
only three years, something near the truth could be collected.
This mode of computation is very common. I have often, on asking
the age of any person, received for answer, that the individual
concerning whom the enquiry was made, had been born in the first,
second, or third year of such a governor. The dreadful famine of
1793 is also an era from which the peasants date many circumstances.</p>

<p>Old Apollinario was staying at Conception with a friend, and I requested
him to come down to my place every evening for the purpose
of teaching some of the young persons their prayers, a task of
which I knew him to be fond, as he considered this to be a
meritorious action; one by which he would have still further services
to plead in his favour with the Virgin and St. Peter, as he himself
told me. When he came to give his report to me of the progress
of each negro, I liked much to keep him, that I might converse with
him. He often spoke of the Jesuits, under the name of the <i>Padres
da Companhia</i>; he was fond of them, but he added, “I must not
speak well of them, for our prince does not like them; and yet they
did a great deal of good too.” He said that they were true and saint-like
<i>padres</i>, very different to those of the present day. He was much
surprised at my knowing any thing about them; he said, “You
were not alive at the time they were here, and even if you had been
alive, you could not have been in Pernambuco; therefore how is it
that you know of their existence at the time of which I speak.” I
never could make him perfectly comprehend how I obtained my
knowledge of them. But he was not the only person whose comprehension,
thus taken by surprise, could not contain the new ideas
which were imparted, by the knowledge of the existence of books
spread all over the world, and of men who wrote for the instruction
of others. Some of these people with whom I conversed were much
puzzled, when I spoke of the variety of languages and countries in
the world; “then,” they would say, “how is it that people understand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
each other?” To this I answered, that these languages were to
be acquired by study. “Yes, I understand you,” they would rejoin
“you are all much cleverer than we are here<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a>; we could not
learn any language but our own.” These people were invariably
humble, and always ready to receive instruction.</p>

<p>The peasantry of the sugar plantation districts near to the coast,
and the fishermen are of characters nearly similar, but the former are
more favourably spoken of than the latter, and I cannot avoid saying,
that I should prefer as a servant a man who had been brought up as
a planter of mandioc, to one whose life had been passed upon a <i>jangada</i>.
These people are said to be less courageous, less sincere, and
less hospitable than the Sertanejos; but they are likewise less vindictive,
more obedient, more easily guided, and more religious; and
though their knowledge is very confined, still their frequent communication
with Recife and other towns renders them, of course, less
unacquainted with what passes in the world, than the inhabitants of
the interior. The free schools which are established in many places
are of much service, and although reading for amusement is totally beyond
the comprehension even of many persons of the secondary rank,
still the acquirement of the rudiments of knowledge prepare them
for improvement, when books begin to make their way. Some of
my neighbours, both at Itamaraca and at Jaguaribe, chanced at times
to come in whilst I was reading, and would be curious to know how
it was that I could find amusement in being so employed. I remember
one man saying to me, “You are not a priest, and therefore why
do you read; is that a breviary in which you are reading?” On another
occasion, I was told that I had got the character among the
people of colour in the neighbourhood of being very holy<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a>, for that
I was always reading. A person who can read, write, and keep accounts
has attained the height of perfection, and is much respected;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
or rather of late years, one who does not know how to do these things
is looked down upon. The women particularly, pride themselves
upon the superiority which they enjoy by this means; by which
they are brought to an equality with their husbands. In the above
general character of the free people, I do not include the planters of
large property, for their acquirements are oftentimes considerable;
and the Indians too are quite separate, owing to their degraded state;
however, I include the white persons of small property: it is surprising,
though extremely pleasing, to see how little difference is
made between a white man, a mulatto, and a creole negro, if all are
equally poor and if all have been born free. I say surprising, because
in the English, French, and Dutch colonies, the distinction is
so decidedly marked; and among the Spaniards, lines are even struck
between the several shades of colour.</p>

<p>I recollect Apollinario telling me of his distress on one occasion,
when he resided in the Varzea. He met the vicar of that parish on
horseback with the sacrament, which he had been taking to some
sick person. The rain poured in torrents, and the mud in the road
was half way up to the knees; but yet it was necessary to pay the
usual respect, consequently the old creole went down upon one knee,
and as the priest passed, he cried out, “Pardon me, Sir vicar, for this
one knee, but if I was to put both to the ground, I could not again
rise.” He told me this with perfect gravity, and I perceived that he
thought this circumstance would be recorded against him as one of
his heaviest sins.</p>

<p>One day the old man came to me with a face of dismay, to shew
me a ball of leaves tied up with <i>cypô</i>, which he had found under a
couple of boards, upon which he slept in an out-house; for he had
removed from the house of his friend in the town to my place.
The ball of leaves was about the size of an apple. I could not
imagine what had caused his alarm, until he said that it was <i>mandinga</i>,
which had been set for the purpose of killing him; and he
bitterly bewailed his fate, that at his age any one should wish to
hasten his death, and to carry him from this world before our Lady<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
thought fit to send for him. I knew that two of the black women
were at variance; and suspicion fell upon one of them who was acquainted
with the old <i>mandingueiro</i> of Engenho Velho, therefore she
was sent for. I judged that the <i>mandinga</i> was not set for Apollinario,
but for the negress whose business it was to sweep the ouhouse.
I threatened to confine the suspected woman at Pillar, and
then to send her to Para, unless she discovered the whole affair;
this she did, after she heard me tell the manager to prepare to take
her to Pillar. She said that the <i>mandinga</i> was placed there to make
one of the negroes dislike her fellow slave and prefer her to the
other. The ball of <i>mandinga</i> was formed of five or six kinds of
leaves of trees, among which was the pomegranate leaf; there were
likewise two or three bits of rag, earth of a peculiar kind, ashes
which were of the bones of some animal; and there might be other
ingredients besides, but these were what I could recognise. The
woman either could not from ignorance, or would not, give any information
respecting the several things of which the ball was composed.
I made this serious matter of the <i>mandinga</i>, from knowing
the faith which not only many of the negroes have in it, but also
some of the mulatto people; however I explained to every one that
I was angry with her from the bad intention of the scheme, and not
from any belief that it would have any effect. There is another
name for this kind of charm; it is <i>feitiço</i>, and the initiated are called
<i>feitiçeiros</i>; of these there was one formerly at the plantation of St.
Joam, upon the island, who became so much dreaded that his master
sold him to be sent to Maranham.</p>

<p>Old Apollinario was useful to me in taking care of my poultry.
I had great quantities of the common fowl, and as I had cleared the
land to a considerable distance around the house, the fowls had a
good range without being molested by the foxes. I had ducks,
turkeys, and pigeons; the young of these last were frequently destroyed
by the <i>timbu</i>; this animal is about the size of a small cat, and
has a long tail, which is scaly and whitish; the colour of the body is
dark brown, with two white stripes from the nose to the tail down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
the back; the head is long, and the snout is pointed; it has an abdominal
pouch, which is large. When pursued, it soon surrenders,
by coiling itself up in its tail. I give the description as I received it,
for although we watched oftentimes for the purpose of catching one
of these animals, we were not successful. I had some geese at
Jaguaribe and at Itamaraca, but from what cause I know not, the
young ones were scarcely ever reared. Many other persons had
found equal difficulty in this respect with myself. Guinea-fowls are
esteemed, but give much trouble, for their unaccommodating disposition
renders it necessary to keep them separate from all other kinds
of fowl. There is only one pair of peacocks in Pernambuco; they
are in the garden of the widow of a merchant, in the neighbourhood
of Recife. Snipes and wild ducks are to be found in low marshy
grounds; and upon the island at certain times of the year there were
great numbers of wild doves. The bees which I have seen at some
of the farm-houses are preserved in a part of the trunk of the tree
in which they had originally been found; the tree is cut down, and
the portion containing the nest is brought home. The bees are
black, and much smaller than those of Europe, nor is their bite
nearly so painful; the log of wood in which they are preserved is
sawed or cut in some particular manner, which I cannot exactly
describe, by which means the honey can be taken out. The honey
is always liquid. It is used as a medicine rather than as food, for
the small quantities of it which are to be obtained, render the demand
of it for the medical men fully equal to the supply.<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a></p>

<p>In the month of November there arrived a priest upon a visit to
the vicar, whose exertions are incessant on every subject which
relates to the improvement of his country. He had now been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
staying with a friend in the province of Paraiba, and had made a
drawing of a stone upon which were carved a great number of unknown
characters and several figures, one of which had the appearance
of being intended to represent a woman. The stone or rock is
large, and stands in the middle of the bed of a river, which is quite dry
in the summer. When the inhabitants of the neighbourhood saw him
at work in taking this drawing, they said, that there were several
others in different parts of the vicinity, and they gave him the names
of the places. It was his intention to return again the following
year, and seek them out. I should have brought with me a copy of
this curious drawing, if my departure from Pernambuco had not been
hastened from unavoidable circumstances.</p>

<p>I was invited about this period to attend the funeral of a young
married woman of respectable family. I went about five o’clock to
the house of the vicar, that I might go with him and three other
priests. From hence we adjourned at dusk to the church, where the
priests, all of whom were already in their black gowns, put on over
these the short lace rochet, and the vicar took in his hands a large
silver cross. We walked to the house in which the body was laid;
this was habited in the coarse brown cloth of the Franciscan order,
for the deceased had belonged to the lay sisterhood of the Third
Order of St. Francis; the face was uncovered, and the body was laid
upon a bier, the room being lighted with many torches. The habits
in which the bodies of the deceased lay brothers and sisters of the
Third Order are dressed, are obtained from the convents of St.
Francis, and are said to be the habits of deceased friars; but probably
the worn-out dresses of those who still live are likewise sold,
and thus arises a considerable source of revenue to the convent.
There were assembled in the room several of her male relations
and others who had been invited. After a good deal of chaunting, a
wax taper was given to each person present, and these being lighted,
we proceeded to the church which was hard by, walking in pairs;
the bier followed, carried by four persons, and there was chaunting as
we went along. In the middle of the body of the church, a scaffolding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
was erected of about four feet from the ground, and upon this the
bier was placed, the attendants standing round whilst the priests
chaunted. The body was soon put into the grave which was in the
church, and there was lime in it. The friends of persons deceased
aim at having as many priests at the funeral as they can collect and
afford to pay; though on the occasion of which I speak, the priests
served without any remuneration, for the young woman was the near
relative of a priest with whom the others were intimate. Likewise
all the neighbours who are of an equal rank with the deceased, are
invited to attend, that the ceremony may be as splendid as possible.
Notwithstanding the manifest inconvenience, and the mischief which
the unwholesomeness of the custom might, and perhaps does cause,
all bodies are buried within the churches. Indeed the prejudice
against being buried in the open air is so great, that even the
priests would not dare to alter this mode of proceeding, supposing
that they wished so to do.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the same month (November) it is customary
for the vicar to determine upon those persons who are to sustain the
expences of the nine evenings previous to the festival of Our Lady
of Conception,&mdash;that is to supply the bon-fires, gunpowder, oil, &amp;c.
Each evening is provided for on all these occasions, by one or more
persons of the immediate neighbourhood, and a greater or less
expence is incurred, according to the means and the inclination of
the individuals who have been named. It was my general practice to
accompany the vicar to church on Sundays and holidays, returning
with him to his house to breakfast. I was in the church when he
read over the list of the names of those who were to provide for the
nine evenings, and was somewhat surprised to hear my own in conjunction
with that of a neighbour, for the ninth night. I had however,
some suspicion that this would be the case, for I had heard some
whisperings upon the subject among the secondary people; the custom
is, thus to keep the individuals who are to be concerned ignorant
of what is intended. We began on the following morning to make
preparations for the occasion, and sent to Recife for the colours of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
several ships, some gunpowder, fireworks, and a few of the musicians
of the band of the Olinda regiment, applying through a friend for
the consent of their colonel. We likewise sent for Nicolau, a creole
black, and a tailor by trade; but whose merry tongue and feet made
him like dancing and singing better than the needle: and we agreed
with him to bring over from the village of Pasmado, a set of <i>fandango</i>
performers. The colours were raised upon long staffs, very early
in the morning of our day, in two rows along the area of the town;
and as the sun rose, several guns were fired,&mdash;of those which are
usually made use of at festivals; they are composed of a small and
short iron tube, which has a touch-hole of disproportionate dimensions;
they are placed upright upon the ground, and the match is
then applied. In the course of the day the band played, and in the
evening were kindled about twenty bon-fires in the square of the
village. The houses were illuminated with lamps, which were made
of the half of the rind of an orange, each containing a small quantity
of oil and cotton. There were likewise great numbers of large
crosses, lighted up in the same manner in several parts of the square.
The church was crowded, and the noise of the people was great; the
guns were fired at intervals; the musicians of the festival, with
violins and violoncellos played within the church, and the Olinda
men on the outside; and rockets were let off occasionally; indeed the
confusion was extreme. Some of the numerous horses which stood
in all quarters, tied to railings or to door posts or held by little
children, whilst their masters were amusing themselves, took fright
and broke loose adding not a little to the noise and bustle. All the
affairs in and about the church ended at so late an hour, that the
<i>fandangos</i> were deferred until the following evening. The band had
been playing close to the door of the vicar’s residence, which was
much crowded with several of the first families of the island; and in
the front of the house a great concourse of people was assembled.
At the moment that the music ceased, an <i>improvisatori</i> or <i>glozador</i>, as
these persons are there called, set up his voice, and delivered a few
verses in praise of the vicar; he then praised Our Lady in a strange<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
style, giving her every fine epithet whether appropriate or not,
which came to his recollection. Then he rung changes upon every
body he could think of, and I heard the name of Henrique da Costa,
to which mine was metamorphosed, thrown in every now and then
among the rest. I was praised for my superior piety, in giving so
splendid a night in honour of Our Lady. On the following morning
every arrangement was made for the <i>fandangos</i>. A spacious platform
was erected, in the middle of the area of the town, and in front
of the vicar’s dwelling, raised about three feet from the ground. In
the evening four bon-fires were lighted, two being on each side of the
stage, and soon afterwards the performers made their appearance.
The story which forms the basis of this amusement is invariably the
same; the parts however, are not written, and are to be supplied by
the actors; but these, from practice, know more or less what they
are to say. The scene is a ship at sea, which, during part of the
time is sailing regularly and gently along; but in the latter part of
the voyage she is in distress. The cause of the badness of the
weather remains for a long time unknown; but at last the persons
who are on board discover that it has arisen from the devil, who is
in the ship, under the disguise of the mizen-topmast-man. The
persons represented, are</p>

<p class="pind">
The Captain,<br />
The Master,<br />
The Chaplain,<br />
The Pilot or Mate,<br />
The Boatswain,</p>

<table id="t01" summary="t01">

 <tr>
  <td class="tdw16">The <i>Raçam</i>, or distributor of the rations,<br />
<i>Vasoura</i>, or sweeper of the decks,</td>
  <td class="tdl"><span class="xlarge">}</span></td>
  <td>Two clowns;</td>
 </tr>

</table>

<p>The <i>Gageiro da Gata</i>, or mizen-topmast-man, <i>alias</i> the Devil.<br />
</p>

<p>Twelve men and boys, who are dancers and singers, stand on the
stage, six of them being on each side of it; and the leader of the
chorus sits at the back of the stage with a guitar, with which he keeps
the time, and this person is sometimes assisted by a second guitar
player. A ship is made for the occasion; and when the performers
stepped on to the platform, the vessel appeared at a distance under
full sail, coming towards us upon wheels, which were concealed. As<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
soon as the ship arrived near to the stage it stopped, and the performance
commenced. The men and boys who were to sing and
to dance, were dressed in white jackets and trowsers; they had ribbons
tied round their ankles and arms, and upon their heads they
wore long paper caps, painted of various colours. The guitar player
commenced with one of the favourite airs of the country, and the
chorus followed him, dancing at the same time. The number of
voices being considerable, and the evening extremely calm, the open
air was rather advantageous than the contrary. The scene was
striking, for the bon-fires threw sufficient light to allow of our seeing
the persons of the performers distinctly; but all beyond was dark,
and they seemed to be inclosed by a spacious dome; the crowd of
persons who were near to the stage was great, and as the fires were
stirred and the flame became brighter, more persons were seen beyond
on every side; and at intervals the horses which were standing
still farther off, waiting for their masters.</p>

<p>When the chorus retired, the captain and other superior officers
came forwards, and a long and serious conversation ensued upon the
state of the ship and the weather. These actors were dressed in old
uniforms of the irregular troops of the country. They were succeeded
by the boatswain and the two clowns; the former gave his
orders, to which the two latter made so many objections that the
officer was provoked to strike one of them, and much coarse wit
passed between the three. Soon afterwards came the chaplain in his
gown, and his breviary in his hand; and he was as much the butt of
the clowns, as they were of the rest of the performers. The most
scurrilous language was used by them to him; he was abused, and
was taxed with almost every irregularity possible. The jokes became
at last so very indecent, as to make the vicar order his doors to be
shut. The dancers came on at each change of scene, if I may so say.
I went home soon after the vicar’s doors were closed, and did not see
the conclusion; but the matter ended by throwing the devil overboard,
and reaching the port in safety. The performers do not expect
payment, but rather consider themselves complimented in being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
sent for. They were tradesmen of several descriptions residing at
Pasmado, and they attend on these occasions to act the <i>fandangos</i>, if
requested so to do; but if not, many of them would most probably go
to enjoy any other sport which the festival might afford. We paid
their expences, and gave them their food during their stay; they
were accompanied by their families, which were all treated in the
same manner, to the number of about forty persons.</p>

<p>I here take the opportunity of mentioning another common amusement
at festivals, which is known under the name of <i>comedias</i>; but
this I did not chance to see. A stage of the same kind is erected,
and regular farces are performed; but I believe that women do not
ever appear upon these stages, though they do upon the stage of the
theatre at Recife.</p>

<p>I slept one night at Pillar, and in the morning following accompanied
the chaplain to the fort, who was going to say Mass at his
chapel, as it was a holiday. The fort is situated upon a projecting
sand-bank, and was formerly quite surrounded by water; but the
channel for small craft which ran between the fort and the island, is
now nearly closed by the accumulation of sand at its mouth<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a>.
When we dismounted at the gate, our horses were taken into the fort,
and were put into the commandant’s stable. The sentinel desired
me to take off my spurs, and we then passed through the gate, and
along the covered way until we entered the area in the centre, with
the chapel and other buildings along two sides of it. The commandant
is a captain of the Olinda regiment, an elderly and most
formal man, full of etiquette; and all the other officers are of the same
standing. I was introduced to the chief, and we then proceeded to
the chapel. Forgetful of necessary forms, I had placed myself next
to the wall on the right hand side of the chapel; but the commandant
would not give up his right, and therefore reminded me to
move, that he might take that place. As soon as the Mass was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
ended we took our leave. Some idea of the state of the works may
be formed from the following anecdote. A former chaplain was
dismissed from his situation owing to the non-observance on his
part of established regulations. The gate was opened for his admission,
and that of any other person who might wish to hear Mass on
Sundays and holidays; but on one occasion, he unfortunately espied
the commandant standing in the area of the fort, through a breach
in the walls, upon which, instead of going round to the gate, he
rode unceremoniously through the breach in his anxiety to greet
the commandant, who was much disconcerted at the occurrence. At
the time I was there, the garrison consisted of militia-men; and an
idea of the discipline of these may be formed from the following circumstance,
which took place only a short time before my visit to
the fort. The adjutant, who was between seventy and eighty years
of age, threatened to strike or gently touched with his cane one of
the men who had refused to hear Mass; the fellow way-laid the old
officer one evening, and gave him several blows of which he died.
The soldier absconded, and was not again heard of. The guns were
in a very bad state, and the usual supply of powder was merely sufficient
for the salutes on days of gala; there were indeed some heaps
of balls, upon which the rust surpassed the quantity of sound iron.</p>

<p>In the course of this year some of my friends from Recife came to
see me; I had been often at Amparo, and at the houses of several
other planters; but I do not particularly mention any of these visits,
for they did not discover any thing new. I went to Recife three or
four times. After the commencement of the rains in 1815, I left
Itamaraca with Manoel about four o’clock one afternoon, having
been detained thus late by unforeseen occurrences. The weather
was fine, and as the moon would rise early, I thought that the evening
would be pleasant; but when we were about three leagues from
the island, the rain began to pour, and when we reached the plantation
of Inhaman, which is half a league farther, we were completely
wet through. Immediately beyond this place, the road is on one
side bordered by a steep hill, from which the water ran down in such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
great quantities, that the horses were nearly up to their knees in it;
however we gained the great cattle track, and stopped at a liquor
shop by the road-side. I bought a considerable quantity of rum,
which I threw over my head and shoulders and into my boots, and
Manoel did the same; each of us likewise drank a good dose of it.
This practice is very general; I had for some time followed it, and although
I had been much exposed to the rain in the course of the
preceding year, had not suffered from it, not having experienced
another attack of ague; but perhaps this is not attributable to precaution,
but to being seasoned to the climate.</p>

<p>When we arrived at the village of Paratibi, night had nearly closed
in. I met with Antonio, (the man who was way-laid when I resided
at Jaguaribe) and he wished me to stay at his cottage, but I preferred
going on, now that we were completely wet through. As we were
ascending the hill beyond Paratibi, I was in hopes of a fine night,
for the moon was clear, but she did not afford us light for many
minutes. In the valley of Merueira the rain again came on, with vivid
lightning; and in going through the wood beyond the valley, the darkness
was so great, as to prevent me from seeing Manoel’s horse, excepting
now and then during the flashes of lightning; although the
animal upon which he rode was of a grey colour, approaching to white,
and mine was sometimes touching his, for he rode in front. When we
arrived near to the hill which descends on the side nearest to Recife,
I reminded him to keep to the left, for the precipice is dangerous on
the right hand side; but he did not understand me or his horse was
restive, and was going too much to the right, when he slipped and
fell on one side within a few yards of the place which he was to
avoid. I dismounted to assist Manoel, but only saw his situation by
the flashes of lightning. I asked him after himself, his horse, and
his pistol, and to each question received for answer that all was well.
I then said to him “Where is the road;” for I had turned round in
different ways so frequently in assisting him, that I had no notion of
the direction which we ought to take to find the road; and indeed
at one moment I had formed the idea of remaining where we were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
until the break of day. But on again asking Manoel if he was certain
respecting the right direction, his answer was in an angry voice,
for he was wet and bruised, “I see the road, don’t be afraid Sir.”
He led, and I followed him, each leading his horse; we descended
side-ways, for the ground was too slippery owing to the rain to allow
us to advance in any other manner. My horse struck me with his
head several times, and he too every now and then narrowly escaped
falling. The width of the road is about six feet; there is on one
side a precipice of great height, which has been formed by the torrents
in the rainy season; these have caused the ground to fall in, and
have now worn it quite away; on the other side, the declivity is
less perpendicular, but it is covered with the short stumps of trees,
among which there is no possibility of treading safely without a sufficient
light. We reached the bottom without accident, and when we
entered the village of Beberibi, the rain nearly ceased, and the night
likewise was clearer, but the moon had set. We crossed the hill
beyond Beberibi very slowly, and arrived at Agua Fria, the residence
of one of my friends distant from Recife two leagues, between one
and two o’clock in the morning. If the weather had been fine, we
should have arrived between eight and nine o’clock in the evening
preceding. The instinct (if I may so call it) which is possessed by
the Indians, by a great number of the negroes, and indeed by many
individuals of mixed casts in finding out the right roads, often surprised
me, but never more than on this occasion. I could not see
any thing, but Manoel certainly did feel that he was quite sure of
being in the right path, else he would not have spoken so positively;
he had a considerable stock of courage; but was always cool and
collected.</p>

<p>At Agua Fria I passed some of the pleasantest hours of my residence
in Brazil. The owner of the place is an English gentleman, to
whom I owe many obligations; we were on most intimate terms,
indeed I felt as much at home at Agua Fria as at Itamaraca. The
spot was in the rudest state when he took possession of it; but although
the soil was not propitious, the <i>sitio</i> (settlement) was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
advancing; he had built a good house, and was erecting out-houses,
making fences, and planting useful and ornamental trees. The
place had been infested by red ants, but with much labour
they had been destroyed, by digging into the ground for the nests.
Behind the house there was a lake of considerable extent, which had
been formed by the course of a rivulet having been stopped through the
accumulation of loose white sand in the part which is now the road;
so that the road is higher than the lake on one side, and the land
along which the river formerly ran on the other side. When the
waters rise in the winter the lake overflows and runs across the road,
but during the greatest part of the year the road is dry, or nearly so.
If the lake was drained, the settlement of Agua Fria would be worth
ten times its present value, for the boundaries of it are the channel
of the rivulet. This lake is covered over with reeds, rushes and
coarse grass, and the roots of these plants have formed a thick coating
over the water, which would not support the weight of a man,
but much labour is required to cut through it.</p>

<p>There were numbers of <i>jacarès</i> or alligators<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> in this lake, which
rendered it dangerous to work in cutting away the rushes, which it
was necessary to do, for the purpose of forming an open space in
which the horses could be watered and washed, and indeed the grass
was eaten by them when other kinds failed in the dry season. I may
here mention some others of the lizard tribe. The <i>camaleam</i> (<i>lacerta
Iguana</i>) is often to be met with; also the <i>tijuaçu</i>, which is, I believe,
the <i>lacerta teguixin</i>; this is very common. There is likewise the <i>calango</i>,
which is smaller than the other two; these three species are
all of them eaten by the lower orders of people. The <i>vibra</i> and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
<i>lagartixa</i> are two small species of lizard, which are continually to be
seen in all situations; in and upon the houses, in the gardens and
in the woods; they do good rather than harm, for they eat flies, spiders,
&amp;c. and they are to my eyes very pretty creatures; their activity, and
at the same time their tameness, made me fond of them.</p>

<p>In my rides to Recife through the Merueira wood I always heard
the hoarse croaking of the <i>sapo cururu</i> (<i>rana ventricosa</i>), and also of
the <i>sapo boi</i> or ox-toad, both of which made a most disagreeable and
dismal noise; they were particularly active on the rainy night which
I have above described. The constant noise which the crickets make
as soon as the sun sets, fails not to annoy those persons who have recently
arrived in the country; and I recollect that on the first evening
which I spent in the country on my arrival at Pernambuco, I
stopped several times when conversing, as if waiting to let the noise
cease before I proceeded; but this wore off (as it does with every one),
and latterly I did not hear the noise even when it was spoken of in
my presence. However if one of them gets into a house, there is no
resting until it be dislodged, owing to the shrillness of its whistle.
The body of the insect is about one inch or one inch and a half in
length, and the legs are long; the whole of the insect is green. There
is another species which is distinguished by the name of <i>gryllo branco</i>,
or the white cricket; it has likewise a sharp whistle; may not this be
the same insect as the former, in a different state? There is likewise
the <i>gryllo de feijam</i> or bean cricket, which is so called from the destruction
which it makes in the plantations of the French bean; it
is of a dusky brown colour, approaching to black.</p>

<p>I was invited in January 1815 to attend a christening at the sugar
plantation of Macaxeira, which is the largest and the most valuable
in every respect of the three in the island. The vicar, another
priest, a captain of the <i>ordenanças</i>, and myself, set off early on the
morning of the day appointed. We rode through the plantation of
St. Joam, and spoke to the owner, who was preparing to follow us
with all his family. He is a Portugueze who has accumulated a
large fortune in Brazil, and has married one of the daughters of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
owner of the place to which we were going. This person and his
immediate relatives will in the course of a short time probably possess
one half of the island of Itamaraca. We were received at Macaxeira
by the father and uncles of the child; and afterwards the
grandmother, who is a widow lady and the owner of the estate, made her
appearance, and by degrees we saw the younger ladies of many of the
neighbouring families. As soon as the christening was over, the
day was devoted to eating and drinking and playing at cards. When
the men had left the table after dinner, the cloth was again laid, and
the ladies sat down to dine; but one of the priests declared that this
separation was barbarous, and seating himself again, was followed by
several other men, and thus they dined a second time. The evening
ended rather boisterously, but good humouredly; the wine was poured
out into tumblers, and these being as frequently emptied as if they
had been smaller, only a few of the guests returned home the same
night; but those who remained crept off early and quietly on the
following morning.</p>

<p>I accompanied the vicar to Pillar to pass the <i>intrudo</i> at that place.
We set off on the Saturday afternoon, and on our arrival found that
the whole clan from Macaxeira and St. Joam had taken up their quarters
close to the house which we were to inhabit. In the evening a
tight rope dancer was to exhibit in the open air, and at the appointed
hour he took his station, and went through several of the common
feats of activity with considerable neatness. He was paid in a singular
manner. Before he began to dance, the clown cried out, “Here
goes to the health of the vicar,” then, after the performer had danced
for a few minutes, he stopped, and the clown came to our party, and
with many jokes and much pretended ignorance of the vicar’s person,
he found him out and asked for a donation, as is the custom; this
being acceded to, and the vicar having given what he thought proper,
the clown returned to the rope-dancer, upon which a shout was
set up by those who were round about him, which was intended as
an acknowledgment for his generosity. Then the clown mentioned
the name of some other person, and so forth. After the dancer had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
exhibited to the health of several persons, a slack rope was hung
between two coco trees and at a great height from the ground: to
this the man removed, where he continued dancing until a late
hour to the health of every one whose name his clown could
think of.</p>

<p>On the following day, after the service of the church was over, the
<i>intrudo</i> jokes and tricks began, and before the conclusion of the sport
in the evening, each person had been obliged to change his cloaths
several times. The ladies joined with heart and soul, and particularly
the good old lady of Macaxeira, who was wet through and
through, and yet carried on the war. The priests were as riotous as
the rest, but their superiority of manner even here was perceivable;
their jokes were well timed, and were not accompanied by any brutality
of behaviour; there was a seeming deference in their manner,
when they were drenching the person upon whom they made an
attack, and they took care that what they threw was clean, which
with others did not always happen.</p>

<p>On Monday morning every one rose fresh for action, and to work
we went until three o’clock in the afternoon, scarcely affording time
for eating. We then adjourned to the sea-shore, for the purpose of
witnessing the christening of the king of the Moors. On this day
all the <i>jangadas</i> and canoes were put in requisition; the owners of
them and others of the inhabitants of the neighbourhood were divided
into two parties, Christians and Moors. A stage was erected at low
water mark upon high poles, and this was intended to represent a
Moorish fortress; the affair was so timed that the tide should be at the
height at the commencement of the sport, by which means the stage was
surrounded by the water. Upon the sea-shore were two high thrones,
with canopies made of counterpanes, &amp;c. These were at the distance
of about three hundred yards from each other, and were placed immediately
above high water mark. The Christian king sat upon one of
them, and the Moorish king upon the other, both of them being habited
in fine flowing robes. The affair began by the former dispatching
one of his officers on horseback to the latter, requiring him to undergo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
the ceremony of baptism, which he refused to do. Several other
couriers passed from each side, all of whom were on horseback, and
fantastically dressed in loose garments. War being declared the
numerous <i>jangadas</i> and canoes of each party were soon in motion,
making towards the fortress in the water; some were going to assist
in protecting it, and others to obtain possession of it. The persons
who were in the fort were now seen preparing for its defence; there
was much firing, and at last, after many struggles on both sides, it was
taken by the Christians. The Moorish vessels however escaped and
landed their crews, the opposite party doing the same. The armies
met on shore and fought hand to hand for a considerable time, but
in the end the Moorish king was taken prisoner, hurled from his
throne, and forcibly baptised. The whole affair was very gay, for
the sands were crowded with people who were all in their best cloaths,
finery of many kinds being displayed&mdash;silks, satins, muslins, and
printed cottons; ornaments of gold and of precious stones; bonnets
of straw, and of silks, and ribbons of all colours in great quantities;
shoes, white, black, and of various tints; then there were coats
that had not for many a day seen the light; cotton and cloth jackets
made for the occasion, embroidered waistcoats, and others more
general of less costly materials; pantaloons of nankeen and of various
other light materials; cocked hats, a few of beaver and of straw, and
round ones many; half boots, and shoes and buckles.</p>

<p>There appeared at Pillar one of the <i>Valentoens</i>, who had often
created great disturbances in many parts, and although his apprehension
was much desired, he trod the soil of Pillar with great confidence,
as if he was aware that his person was secure owing to his
great reputation for intrepidity; but his safety proceeded from my
friend of the stockade prison not being the chief magistrate of the
place for the year. On the morrow all parties were preparing to return
home; we saw the ladies set off on horseback, and according
to a strange custom, a number of metal pans were collected, and as
they went away from the door the persons who remained beat the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
pans against each other, so as to make a gingling noise. This is
practised as a joke, and on this occasion, as is usual, created much
laughter.</p>

<p>Shortly after this period I received advices from England, which
rendered necessary my return home. I gave up my plan of residing
in Brazil with reluctance; but I am now much rejoiced that it so
happened. Yet at that time it required some resolution to leave the
people, the place, and the things in which I had taken deep interest,&mdash;my
negroes and free people,&mdash;my horses and my dogs, and
even my cats and fowls;&mdash;the house and the garden which I had
been improving and forming,&mdash;and the fields which I had cleared,
and was cultivating. All this, believe me, cost much pain in leaving;
but thanks to those who desired that it should be so. I should
have soon become a Brazil planter; the state in which a man who
rules over slaves is placed, is not likely to make him a better creature
than he would under other circumstances have been. I should
perhaps shortly have been totally unfit to become a member of any
other society; my inclinations led me to like the life which I was
leading:&mdash;I was young, and was independent and had power. Although
I am fully aware of the evils which attend a feudal state of
society, I liked to have dependants. I might have become so arbitrary,
so much a lover of a half savage life; I might have contracted
so great a relish for rambling, have become so unsettled, as to have
been dissatisfied with what is rational and to be desired in this
world. Until lately I cherished the hope of being able to return to
that country, with the means of crossing the continent of South
America; but I have now given this up from unavoidable circumstances,
and even my wishes have taken another bias; but God only
knows whether it may not yet be my fate to enter into the scheme;
accident, and inclinations over which I have no controul, may so
direct. England is my country, but my native soil is Portugal; I belong
to both, and whether in the company of Englishmen, of Portugueze,
or of Brazilians, I feel equally among my countrymen. My<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
constant and fervent prayers are offered up for their prosperity, and
for a continuance of that friendship which has borne the test of so
many years. Fresh causes have lately occurred for rivetting the links
which bind the two united nations; their people have fought together,
and neither have been found wanting.</p>

<p class="pch">AGRICULTURE.&mdash;SUGAR PLANTATIONS.</p>

<p class="drop-cap13">AGRICULTURE in Brazil<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> had not for many years, until very
lately, received any improvement; and even now it is only
slowly and with much difficulty that innovations are made. It is
quite hopeless to expect a rapid change of system among men who
had not even heard that there existed other agriculturists besides
themselves; who were astonished to learn that Brazil was not the
only country in which sugar was made; who know not, or at least did
not know until very lately, that there was any other nation than their
own; who imagined that Portugal had possession of every thing
worth having in this world; in fact, whose ignorance was extreme.
Most of the planters of the inland country, and even most of those near
to the coast who reside entirely upon their estates, were, and many
still are, in this state. They continue year after year the system
which was followed by their fathers, without any wish to improve,
and indeed without the knowledge that any improvement could be
made. But the freedom of commercial intercourse with other
nations has here, as in every thing else, had its effect, and the
benefits which are derived from this policy are increasing most
rapidly. One of these is to be perceived in the wish which many of
the planters display to obtain information respecting the management
of the British and French plantations in the Columbian
islands. The persons who thus in enriching themselves, are likewise
doing the greatest good to their country, are the proprietors of
sugar-mills, who reside in Recife altogether or who make frequent
visits to it; these men enter into company, hear what is going on in
the world, read the few books which are to be obtained, and soon
assent to new ideas. Many of the merchants now possess this kind
of property, which has fallen into their hands, either in payment of
debts or by purchase; and these men have no prejudices to conquer
respecting any particular plan of operations. Some of the improvements
which are proposed are of such self-evident utility, as to carry
with them conviction as soon as they are mentioned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span></p>

<h3 class="p2">PLANTING THE SUGAR-CANE.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> lands in Brazil are never grubbed up<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a>, either for planting the
sugar-cane, or for any other agricultural purposes. The inconveniences<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
of this custom are perceivable more particularly in high
lands; because all of these that are of any value are naturally covered
with thick woods. The cane is planted among the numerous stumps
of trees, by which means much ground is lost, and as the sprouts
from these stumps almost immediately spring forth, (such is the
rapidity of vegetation,) the cleanings are rendered very laborious.
These shoots require to be cut down, sometimes even before the cane
has forced its way to the surface of the ground. The labour likewise
is great every time a piece of land is to be put under cultivation,
for the wood must be cut down afresh; and although it
cannot have reached the same size which the original timber had attained,
still, as several years are allowed to pass between each period
at which the ground is planted, the trees are generally of considerable
thickness<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a>. The wood is suffered to remain upon the land
until the leaves become dry; then it is set on fire, and these are
destroyed with the brushwood and the smaller branches of the trees.
Heaps are now made of the remaining timber, which is likewise
burnt. This process is universally practised in preparing land for
the cultivation of any plant. I have often heard the method much
censured as being injurious in the main to the soil, though the crop
immediately succeeding the operation may be rendered more luxuriant
by it. I have observed that the canes which grew upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
spots where the heaps of timber and large branches of trees had been
burnt, were of a darker and richer green than those around them,
and that they likewise over-topped them. After the plant-canes or
those of the first year’s growth are taken from the lands, the field-trash,
that is the dried leaves and stems of the canes which remain
upon the ground, are set fire to, with the idea that the ratoons, that
is the sprouts from the old roots of the canes, spring forth with
more luxuriance, and attain a greater size by means of this practice<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a>.
The ratoons of the first year are called in Brazil <i>socas</i>; those of the
second year, <i>resocas</i>; those of the third year, <i>terceiras socas</i>, and so forth.
After the roots are left unencumbered by burning the field-trash, the
mould is raised round about them; indeed if this was neglected,
many of these roots would remain too much exposed to the heat of
the sun, and would not continue to vegetate. Some lands will continue
to give ratoons for five or even seven years; but an average
may be made at one crop of good ratoons fit for grinding, another of
inferior ratoons for planting or for making molasses to be used in
the still-house, and a third which affords but a trifling profit, in
return for the trouble which the cleanings give.<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a></p>

<p>I have above spoken more particularly of high lands; the low and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
marshy grounds, called in Brazil <i>varzeas</i>, are however those which are
the best adapted to the cane, and indeed upon the plantations that do
not possess some portion of this description of soil, the crops are very
unequal, and sometimes almost entirely fail, according to the greater
or less quantity of rain which may chance to fall in the course of the
year. The <i>varzeas</i> are usually covered with short and close brushwood,
and as these admit, from their rank nature, of frequent cultivation,
they soon become easy to work. The soil of these, when it is new,
receives the name of <i>pàûl</i>; it trembles under the pressure of the feet,
and easily admits of a pointed stick being thrust into it; and though
dry to appearance, it requires draining. The <i>maçapé</i> marle is often
to be met with in all situations; it is of a greenish white colour, and
if at all wet, it sticks very much to the hoe; it becomes soon dry at
the surface, but the canes which have been planted upon it seldom
fail to revive after rain, even though a want of it should have been
much felt. The white marle, <i>barro branco</i>, is less frequently found; it
is accounted extremely productive. This clay is used in making bricks
and coarse earthen ware, and also for claying the sugar. Red earth
is occasionally met with upon the sides of hills near to the coast; but
this description of soil belongs properly to the cotton districts.
Black mould is common; and likewise a loose and brownish soil, in
which a less or greater proportion of sand is intermixed. It is, I believe,
generally acknowledged that no land can be too rich for the
growth of the sugar cane. One disadvantage, however, attends soil
that is low and quite new, which is, that the canes run up to a great
height without sufficient thickness, and are thus often lodged before
the season for cutting them arrives. I have seen rice planted upon
lands of this kind on the first year, to decrease their rankness and
render them better adapted to the cane on the succeeding season.<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
Some attempts have been made to plant cane upon the lands which
reach down to the edge of the mangroves, and in a few instances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
pieces of land, heretofore covered by the salt water at the flow of the
tide, have been laid dry by means of draining for the same purpose;
but the desired success has not attended the plan, for the canes have
been found to be unfit for making sugar; the syrup does not coagulate,
or at least does not attain that consistence which is requisite, and
therefore it can only be used for the distilleries.<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a></p>

<p>The general mode of preparing the land for the cane is by holing
it with hoes. The negroes stand in a row, and each man strikes his
hoe into the ground immediately before him, and forms a trench
of five or six inches in depth; he then falls back, the whole row
doing the same, and they continue this operation from one side of the
cleared land to the other, or from the top of a hill to the bottom.
The earth which is thrown out of the trench remains on the lower
side of it. In the British colonies this work is done in a manner
nearly similar, but more systematically<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a>. The lands in Brazil are
not measured, and every thing is done by the eye. The quantity
of cane which a piece of land will require for planting is estimated
by so many cart loads; and nothing can be more vague than this
mode of computation, for the load which a cart can carry depends
upon the condition of the oxen, upon the nature of the road, and upon
the length of the cane. Such is the awkward make of these vehicles
that much nicety is necessary in packing them, and if two canes will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>about fit into a cart lengthways, much more will be conveyed than
if the canes are longer and they double over each other.</p>

<p>The plough is sometimes used in low lands, upon which draining
has not been found necessary; but such is the clumsy construction
of the machine of which they make use, that six oxen are yoked to
it<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a>. Upon high lands the stumps of the trees almost preclude the
possibility of thus relieving the labourers.</p>

<p>The trenches being prepared, the cuttings are laid longitudinally
in the bottom of them, and are covered with the greatest part of the
mould which had been taken out of the trench. The shoots begin
to rise above the surface of the ground in the course of twelve or
fourteen days. The canes undergo three cleanings from the weeds and
the sprouts proceeding from the stumps of the trees; and when the
land is poor, and produces a greater quantity of the former and contains
fewer of the latter, the canes require to be cleaned a fourth time.
The cuttings are usually from twelve to eighteen inches in length,
but it is judged that the shorter they are, the better. If they are
short, and one piece of cane rots, the space which remains vacant is
not so large as when the cuttings are long, and they by any accident
fail. The canes which are used for planting are generally ratoons,
if any exist upon the plantation, but if there are none of these, the
inferior plant canes supply their places. It is accounted more economical
to make use of the ratoons for this purpose, and many persons
say that they are less liable to rot than the plant canes. In
the British sugar islands the cuttings for planting “are commonly
the tops of the canes which have been ground for sugar<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a>.” But in
Brazil the tops of the canes are all thrown to the cattle, for there is
usually a want of grass during the season that the mills are at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
work<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a>. In the British colonies, the canes are at first covered with only
a small portion of mould; and yet they are as long in forcing their
way to the surface as in Brazil, though in the latter a more considerable
quantity of earth is laid upon them. I suppose that the
superior fatness of the Brazilian soil accounts for this. Upon rich
soils the cuttings are laid at a greater distance, and the trenches are
dug farther from each other, than upon those which have undergone
more frequent cultivation, or which are known to possess less
power from their natural composition. The canes which are planted
upon the former throw out great numbers of sprouts, which spread
each way; and although when they are young the land may appear
to promise but a scanty crop, they soon close, and no opening is to
be seen. It is often judged proper to thin the canes, by removing
some of the suckers at the time that the last cleaning is given, and
some persons recommend that a portion of the dry leaves should also
be stripped off at the same period, but on other plantations this is not
practised.</p>

<p>The proper season for planting is from the middle of July to the
middle of September, upon high lands, and from September to the
middle of November in low lands. Occasionally the great moisture
of the soil induces the planter to continue his work until the beginning
of December, if his people are sufficiently numerous to answer
all the necessary purposes. The first of the canes are ready to
be cut for the mill in September of the following year, and the crop
is finished usually in January or February. In the British sugar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
islands the canes are planted from August to November and are
“ripe for the mill in the beginning of the second year.” Thus this
plant in Brazil requires from thirteen to fifteen months to attain its
proper state for the mill; and in the Columbian islands it remains
standing sixteen or seventeen months.<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a></p>

<p>I did not discover, nor hear it mentioned, that the cane is liable
to destruction from the <i>blast</i>, which is spoken of by Mr. Edwards, as
doing much injury to the plantations in the British colonies. The
cane is subject certainly to several pests, but they are of a nature
which may be remedied. The rats destroy great quantities<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a>, and
the fox is no less fond of it; and when he gets among it he makes
dreadful havock, for he is only satisfied by cutting down great numbers
of canes, taking only a small portion of each. There is also a
strange custom among the lower orders of people; they scruple not
in passing a field, to cut down and make a bundle of ten or a dozen
canes, from which they suck the juice as they go along, or preserve
some of them to carry home. The devastation which is committed
in this manner is incalculable, in the fields that border upon much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
frequented paths. It is a custom; and many persons think that the
owner has scarcely a right to prevent these attacks upon his property.</p>

<p>The planters of Brazil have not yet arrived at the period (which is
not however far distant) of being under the necessity of manuring
their lands. I heard of very few instances in which this is the practice.
The cane-trash, that is, the rind of the cane from which the
juice has been extracted, is thus entirely lost, with the exception of
the small part of it which is eaten by the cattle. The manure of
cattle is likewise of no use. Lands are not yet of sufficient value to
oblige each planter to confine himself to certain pieces of ground for
certain purposes, with any sort of regularity. The population of the
country is yet too scanty to make every man husband what he possesses,
or to oblige him to draw in and give room for others, as,
imperceptibly, these others require that he should do so. For the
present, the planter finds that it is more convenient to change from
one piece of land to another, as each becomes unfit to be cultivated;
he allows the wood to grow up again as soon as the ratoons no longer
spring forth and yield him a sufficient profit to compensate for the
trouble of cleaning them.</p>

<p>The Otaheitan or the Bourbon cane has been brought from
Cayenne to Pernambuco, since the Portugueze obtained possession
of that settlement. I believe the two species of cane are much alike,
and I have not been able to discover which of them it is. Its advantages
are so apparent, that after one trial on each estate, it has superseded
the small cane which was in general use. The Cayenne cane, as
it is called in Pernambuco, is of a much larger size than the common
cane; it branches so very greatly, that the labour in planting a piece
of land is much decreased, and the returns from it are at the same
time much more considerable. It is not planted in trenches, but
holes are dug at equal distances from each other, in which the cuttings
are laid. This cane bears the dry weather better than the
small cane; and when the leaves of the latter begin to turn brown,
those of the former still preserve their natural colour. A planter in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
the Varzea told me that he had obtained four crops from one piece of
land in three years, and that the soil in question had been considered
by him as nearly worn out, before he planted the Cayenne cane upon
it. Its rind is likewise so hard that the fox cannot make any impression
upon it. The business of the boiling-houses is in general so
slovenly performed, that I could not obtain any exact information
respecting the returns in the manufacturing of it; but most persons
were of opinion that here too some advantage was to be perceived.</p>

<h3 class="p2">THE MILL.</h3>

<p>A sugar-plantation is doubtless one of the most difficult species of
property to manage in a proper manner. The numerous persons
employed upon it, their divers avocations, and the continual change
of occupation, give to the owner or his manager constant motives for
exertion, innumerable opportunities of displaying his activity. A
plantation ought to possess within itself all the tradesmen which are
required for the proper furtherance of its concerns; a carpenter, a
blacksmith, a mason, a potter, and others which it is needless to
name in this place. It is a manufactory as well as a farm, and both
these united must act in unison with each other, and with the seasons
of the year.</p>

<p>The mill ought, properly, to commence grinding the cane in September,
but few of them begin until the middle of October; for the
planting scarcely allows that they should set to work before the latter
period. This is the time of merriment and of willing exertion, and
for some weeks the negroes are all life and spirit; but the continuance
of constant work for the whole of the day and part of the night at
last fatigues them, and they become heavy and fall asleep wherever
they chance to lay their heads.<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span></p>

<p>The mills for grinding the canes are formed of three upright
rollers, which are made of solid timber, entirely cased or rather
hooped in iron, and the hoops are driven on to the wood before they
become quite cool<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a>. The improvement of the “circular piece of
frame-work called in Jamaica the dumb-returner” has not been introduced.
Two men and two women are employed in feeding the
mill with cane; a bundle of it is thrust in between the middle roller
and one of the side rollers, and being received by one of the women,
she passes it to the man who stands-close to her, for the purpose of
being by him thrust between the other side roller and that of the
centre. This operation is continued five or six times until the
juice has been extracted. There appears to be some mismanagement
in this part of the work; for in the British colonies a second
compression “squeezes them completely dry, and sometimes even
reduces them to powder;” and the same occurred in Labat’s time in
the French islands. The dumb-returner tends very greatly to prevent
accidents, which occasionally occur in Brazil through the carelessness
or drowsiness of the slaves. The negroes who thrust the cane in
between the rollers have sometimes allowed their hands to go too
far, and one or both of them having been caught, in some instances,
before assistance could be given, the whole limb and even the body
has been crushed to pieces. In the mills belonging to owners who
pay attention to the safety of their negroes, and whose wish it is to
have every thing in proper order, a bar of iron and a hammer are
placed close to the rollers upon the table (<i>meza</i>) which supports the
cane. The bar is intended to be violently inserted between the
rollers in case of accident, so as to open them, and thus set at liberty
the unfortunate negro. In some instances I have seen lying by the
side of the bar and hammer, a well-tempered hatchet, for the purpose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
of severing the limb from the body, if judged necessary<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a>. On these
unfortunate occasions the screams of the negro have the effect of
urging the horses which draw the mill, to run with increased velocity.
I am acquainted with two or three individuals who now work
their mills with oxen; and they gave as the principal reason for this
change, the decrease of danger to the negroes who feed the mill;
because such is the slowness of these animals, that an accident of the
above description can scarcely happen, and indeed they are stopped
rather than urged to proceed by noise. Some of the mills are turned
by water, but many more would admit of this improvement than
take advantage of it. Most of the mills are worked by horses. There
are no windmills in Pernambuco or in the other provinces which I
visited<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a>. The expence which is incurred in making dams and in
other alterations, is doubtless considerable, and few persons can afford
to lay out the money which these works require; but the conveniences
of working by means of water are various; the number of
animals required upon a plantation is reduced to less than one half;
less pasture land is necessary, and fewer persons need to be employed.
The animals likewise which are thus rendered superfluous
are those which are of the most cost, the most liable to disease, and
the most difficult to feed. Great care and attention is requisite in
preserving the horses, or rather the mares (for these are mostly employed
in this description of work) in a condition to go through with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>the crop; and quantities of cane are cut up and given to them, as
well as molasses. Oxen are usually employed in drawing the carts,
and it is seldom thought necessary to afford any expensive food to
these animals. They pick up as much as they please of the cane-trash
which is thrown out of the mill, and the cane tops are likewise
given to them.</p>

<h3 class="p2">THE BOILING-HOUSE.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the boiling-house the manufactory of sugar in Brazil requires
great alteration. The work is done in a slovenly manner, very little
attention being paid to the minutiæ of the business. The ovens
over which the boilers are placed, are rudely made, and they answer
the purpose for which they are intended in an imperfect manner;
enormous quantities of fuel are consumed, and the negroes who attend
to the ovens are soon worn out. The juice runs from the cane as
it is squeezed between the rollers, into a wooden trough below, and
is from thence conveyed into a cistern made of the same material,
standing in the boiling house. It is received from this cistern into
the great caldron, as it is called, which is a large iron or copper
vessel. The caldron has previously been heated, and when nearly
full, the <i>temper</i> is thrown into it, and the liquor is suffered to boil.
It is now scummed with considerable labour. The work of scumming
is usually performed by free persons, which is owing to two
causes; it demands considerable skill, to which slaves seldom attain;
and the exertion which it requires induces the planter to pay a free
man rather than injure one of his own people.</p>

<p>From this first caldron or clarifier, if I may so call it, the liquor is
ladled out into a long trough or cistern, which is generally made of
the trunk of one tree; and in this it remains until it becomes tepid<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a>.
The labour which the operation of ladling requires is excessive, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
heat and smoke of a boiling-house in a tropical climate increasing
greatly the violence of the exertion. From this trough which holds
the whole of the contents of the great caldron, the liquor when sufficiently
cool is suffered to run into the first copper, and from this it
is removed into a second and a third copper, and some boiling-houses
contain a fourth. From this it is ladled into large jars, called <i>formas</i>,
when the master of the boiling-house judges from the touch that the
syrup has arrived at a proper consistence. The jars are afterwards
taken into the adjoining building, in which the sugar is to undergo
the process of claying. The sugar, after being clayed, is invariably
dried in the sun<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a>. The management of the boiling-houses in the
British sugar islands is arranged in such a manner as to render the
labour much less violent, and much greater nicety has been introduced
in the preparation of the juice.</p>

<p>The boilers are fixed at a considerable height over the large ovens
within which the fire is made. Each boiling-house has two ovens,
one for heating the caldron and the other for the three or four coppers.
The mouths of these are about half as broad as the ovens
themselves. Enormous rolls of timber and the branches of trees are
prepared for the purpose of supplying these ovens with fuel. The
negroes sometimes find it almost impossible to approach them, owing
to the excessive heat which they throw out<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a>. The manner of
conducting the manufacture of sugar was, from what I can collect,
very similar on the whole, in the Columbian islands about the beginning
of the last century, to that which is practised at present in the
parts of Brazil which I visited.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span></p>

<p>The <i>temper</i> which is usually made use of is the ashes of wood calcinated,
of which there are certain species preferred for this purpose<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a>.
Lime is commonly used in the Columbian islands, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
few planters of Pernambuco have lately introduced this alkali into
their boiling houses, but there exists a general prejudice against lime,
under the idea that the sugar with which it has been made is unwholesome;
and this has prevented many persons from adopting it.
No difficulty would be found in introducing it, among the planters
themselves, because the ease with which it is obtained, would soon urge
them to give it a fair trial. Some plantations sell a great portion of
their sugar and rum upon the spot, and several of the lesser ones grind
all their canes for the purpose of making melasses, which they distil
themselves, or sell to the distillers of small capital, who are very
numerous; therefore to the owners of these plantations in particular,
the opinion of the people of the country is of considerable moment.</p>

<p>The planters of Brazil invariably follow the system of claying their
sugars, but the process is too generally known to require any account
of it in this place.</p>

<h3 class="p2">THE STILL-HOUSE.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Brazil planters are more backward in the management of their
still-houses than in any other department of their business. The
stills are earthen jars with small necks, and likewise small at the bottom,
widening upwards considerably, but again straightening on approaching
the neck. The foundation of a circular oven is formed,
and two of these jars are placed within it, one on each side of it, in
a slanting position, with the bottom within the oven and the neck on
the outside, and being thus secured the walls of the oven are built
up against them, and the top is closed in. These stills have round
caps, <i>carapuças</i>, which fit on to the mouths of the jars, and are rendered
perfectly tight by a coat of clay being daubed round the edges,
after the <i>wash</i> has been put into the still and the fire has been lighted
underneath. These caps have on one side a pipe of six inches in
length attached to each of them, and into this is inserted the end of
a brass tube of four feet in length. This tube is placed in a broad
and deep earthen pot or jar containing cold water, and the opposite
end of it reaches beyond the pot. The tube is fixed with a sufficient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
slant to allow of the liquor running freely through it. The
liquor which is obtained from the first distillation is usually sold, without
undergoing any further process. A second distillation is only
practised in preparing a small quantity for the use of the planter’s
house.</p>

<p>The <i>wash</i> ripens for distillation in earthen jars similar to those
which are used for claying sugar, but they are closed at the bottom
instead of being perforated, as must necessarily occur with the latter.
No exact rules are followed in the quantities of each ingredient for
making the <i>wash</i>, because the distillers, who are usually freemen, differ
much in the proportions of each ingredient. Until lately, only a
small number of the planters had any apparatus for distilling, for it
was their practice to sell all the melasses which were produced to
the small distillers. Many of the persons in the lower ranks of life
possess one or two of these rude stills, by which they derive a small
profit without much trouble; fuel is to be had for the pains of
fetching it, and scarcely any man is without a horse. The women
often attend to the still whilst the men are otherwise employed.
However, since the opening of the ports of Brazil to foreign trade, a
considerable quantity of rum has been exported to North America,
and likewise the demand of it for Lisbon has been greater than it
was formerly; the price has consequently risen, and has induced many
of the planters to distil their own melasses. But although this plan
has been adopted, the stills are so totally inadequate to the distillation
of large quantities of rum, that few persons erect a sufficient
number of them to consume the whole of the melasses with which
the sugar furnishes them.<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span></p>

<h3 class="p2">LANDS.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">A sugar</span> plantation of Pernambuco or Paraiba does not require
the enormous capital which is necessary in purchasing and establishing
an estate of the same description in the Columbian islands; but
a certain degree of capital is requisite, otherwise continual distress
will be the consequence of entering into such a concern. The instances
of persons having purchased sugar plantations without any advance
of money are however by no means rare, and even the slaves,
or at least the major part of them, have sometimes been obtained on
long credit at exorbitant prices. This plan was of more frequent
occurrence at the time that the exclusive trading company existed at
Pernambuco; its directors found that it was for the interest of those
concerned to advance every thing which the agriculturist required,
receiving in payment a certain portion of his produce yearly. Although
the company has for many years been abolished, its accounts
have not yet been wound up, and it is astonishing to learn
how considerable a number of plantations are yet indebted to it.
The reputed owners of many of those which are so circumstanced
have oftentimes given to their predecessors only half the purchase-money;
paying interest to the accountant of the company for the
other half. If they can raise a sufficient sum of money for the purpose,
they may strike off the principal of the debt, but if this is not
practicable, they remain in perfect confidence that they will never be
molested for it, provided the interest is paid.</p>

<p>There are a few <i>morgados</i> or entailed estates in Pernambuco, and
I believe in Paraiba likewise; and I have heard that in Bahia there
are a great many. There are also <i>capellados</i> or chapel lands; these
estates cannot be sold, and from this cause are sometimes suffered to
decay, or at any rate they yield much less profit to the State than
they would under other circumstances. The <i>capellado</i> is formed in
this manner: the owner bequeaths a certain part of the produce
or rent of the estate to some particular church, for the purpose of
having masses said for his own soul, or for pious uses of a less selfish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
nature. On this account the estate cannot, according to law, be sold,
so that if the next heir is not rich enough to work the mill himself,
he lets it to some one who possesses a sufficient number of negroes.
The portion which is due to the favoured church being paid, the
owner then remains with the residue of the rent as his share of the
profit. Now, lands even with buildings upon them, are let at so low
a rate, that after the church is paid, and the tenant has deducted
what he has expended in repairing the edifices of the plantation, but
a poor pittance remains for the owner. The <i>engenho</i> of Catû near
to Goiana is placed in these circumstances; the owner lives in the
neighbourhood of the Great House or principal residence, and the
only advantage which he derives from the possession of this most excellent
and extensive estate, is that of residing rent free upon one
corner of it and now and then receiving a trifling sum of money.
Whereas if it could be sold, he would immediately receive a sufficient
sum to place him in easy circumstances; and the estate would undergo
improvement, for the occupier would then have a direct interest in
its advancement. I might mention several other plantations which
are situated in a like manner.</p>

<p>The property of sugar planters, which is directly applied to the
improvement, or to the usual work of their plantations, is not subject
to be seized for debt; this privilege was granted for the encouragement
of the formation of such establishments, but it may have a
contrary effect. The planter is allowed many means of evading the
demands of his creditors, and every thing is permitted to act in his
favour. But thus it is that the government legislates; the revenue is
thought of, instead of equity being regarded as the primary consideration.
Nor does the plan act in the manner which the establishers
of it imagine that it will, for the estates which are labouring
under the disadvantage of being held by men who require such a
law as this to enable them to keep possession of the property would
doubtless, nine times out of ten, yield a greater profit if they passed
into other hands; they could not be in worse, and they might fall into
better. The government need not fear that good estates will, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
present state of Brazil, remain long untenanted. Besides, the rulers of
that kingdom may be very sure that the merchants will be more
careful how they lend their money; and this may sometimes prevent
an honest man from obtaining what he requires for the due advancement
of his labours.<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a></p>

<p>Most of the plantations of the first class are however in the hands
of wealthy persons, and this is becoming more and more the case
every day. The estates which may be said to constitute this class
are those which are situated near to the sea coast, that is, from two to
sixteen miles from it; which possess a considerable portion of low
land adapted to the planting of the sugar-cane,&mdash;another of virgin
wood,&mdash;good pasture land, (for nature must do every thing) and the
possibility of being worked by water. The rains are more regular
near to the coast than at a distance from it, and the facility of conveying
the produce of the estate down some of the small streams or
creeks to a market, are the particular advantages which are derived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
from the vicinity of the sea. The slaves are fed with more ease, and
less expence, and the quantity of food which they themselves have
the means of obtaining from the sea and from the rivulets, enables
them to be less dependent upon the rations of the master than the
slaves of the Mata or districts between the coast and the Sertam. In
a country that is without roads, upon which a wheeled carriage can
be drawn with any degree of regularity of pace or of safety, the difficulty
of removing the large chests in which the sugar is packed,
is a most serious consideration, and this inconvenience alone decreases
the value of lands, however productive they may be, which
are so situated. If a person wishes to purchase property of this
description, he will discover that the plantations which are conveniently
placed, are only to be obtained at high comparative prices,
and by a considerable advance of money; but many of those in the
Mata may be purchased even without any advance, and under the
agreement of small yearly payments of eight to ten <i>per cent.</i> upon the
price.</p>

<p>The lands of sugar plantations are appropriated to five purposes.
These are; the woods,&mdash;the lands for planting canes,&mdash;those which
are cleared for pasturage,&mdash;the provision grounds for the negroes,&mdash;and
the lands which are occupied by free people.</p>

<p>The woods occupy a very considerable portion of the lands belonging
to a plantation; in most cases much more than half the
estate is yet covered with wood, but still I do not think, from what I
saw and heard, that these forests contain so much fine timber as has
been imagined. A tree of any species of valuable timber must now
be purchased. Very little consideration is given to the quantity of
wood that is destroyed in the work of a plantation, in many cases very
unnecessarily. The fences are made of stakes, which are formed of
the trunks of trees, driven into the ground, and to these are fastened
horizontally the stems of younger plants. The best timber, rather
than that of inferior quality, is selected for this purpose, that it may
last the longer under exposure to the heat of the sun and to the
rains. The fuel, likewise, is another most enormous source of destruction;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
and although for this purpose some selection might be
made of the qualities of timber which are less valuable, no thought
is given to the matter. The havock which is committed in bringing
out of the woods a tree that has been felled for any particular purpose
is likewise immense; for many trees are cut down to make a
path from the usual road to the spot upon which the tree which is to
be brought out is laying, that the oxen may enter to convey it away.
It will be said, that the great object is to get rid of the superabundant
quantities of wood, and this is no doubt the case; but according
to the present system, very little land is radically cleared of wood,
and yet the large and valuable timber is undergoing rapid destruction.
Virgin woods however certainly do yet exist to a great
extent. It is said that those of Apepucos, which is near to Recife,
are connected with the woods in the neighbourhood of Goiana, a
distance of fifteen leagues.</p>

<p>Of the lands for planting canes I have already treated.</p>

<p>Each sugar plantation has one large field in which the buildings
are placed. It is very rarely that estates are supplied with a second
inclosure, consequently the cattle, or at least that part of it which is
required after and before crop time for the work which is necessary
to be done during the whole of the year, always remains upon the
spot. These fields are sometimes of considerable extent; I have
seen some of three miles in circumference, or even of more. Few
owners of estates can manage to preserve the field free from brushwood.
The horses which work the mill are usually removed from
the plantation as soon as the crop is finished, and are often sent to
the Sertam to pass the winter, and they return again just before crop-time
on the following year. Indeed such is the importance of having
good pasturage for these animals between the crops, and the advantage
of allowing some of them to rest two years, that every plantation
should have a cattle estate in the interior of the country, as a
necessary appendage. The oxen are often driven to the sea shore
after the crop is over, if the estate is conveniently situated for this
purpose, and are left to graze under the coco-trees until the following<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
season. But they are fond of the young coco-plants, and therefore
it is not in every situation that this can be done.</p>

<p>As the planters commonly feed their slaves, instead of allowing
them a certain portion of each week for the purpose of supplying
themselves, the lands which are set apart for raising their provisions
are of great importance, for it does not answer to the planter to purchase
the vegetable part of the food. The root of the mandioc and
the kidney-bean are the two plants which are chiefly cultivated; of
the first of these I shall soon treat more at large. Maize is not much
used in this part of the country.</p>

<p>An estate contains in general much more land than its owner can
manage or in any way employ, even under the present extravagant
system of changing from one piece of ground to another. I call it
extravagant, because it requires so much space for its operations,
and performs these with more labour than is necessary. This overplus
of land gives room for the habitations of free people in the
lower ranks of life, who live upon the produce which they raise by
their own labour. The tenures by which these persons hold the
lands which they occupy, are most insecure, and this insecurity constitutes
one of the great engines of that power which the landholder
enjoys over his tenants. No agreements are drawn out; but the
proprietor of the land verbally permits the peasant who applies to
him for a place of residence, to inhabit a cottage upon his lands,
under the condition of paying him a trifling rent (from four to eight
mil reis, one to two guineas or rather more;) and he is allowed to cultivate
as much ground as he possibly can by himself, but the rent is increased
if he calls in any one to assist him. Sometimes the verbal
arrangement which is entered into, is that the tenant shall perform
some service in lieu of making his payment in money. The service required
is, for instance, that of going upon errands, or of seeing that
the woods are not destroyed by persons who have not obtained permission
from the owner to cut down timber, and other offices of the
same description.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span></p>

<h3 class="p2">THE BUILDINGS.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> buildings which are usually to be seen upon the plantations
are the following:</p>

<p>The mill; which is either turned by water or by cattle; some
of the plantations possess both of these, owing to the failure of the
water in the dry season; and indeed there are a few estates upon
which the crops are so large as to require that there should be
both.</p>

<p>The boiling-house; which is usually attached to the mill, and is the
most costly part of the apparatus, for the coppers, &amp;c. must be obtained
from Europe.</p>

<p>The claying-house or <i>caza de purgar</i>; which is oftentimes connected
with the boiling-house. It is also generally made use of as
the still-house or distillery.</p>

<p>The chapel; which is usually of considerable dimensions. This
building and all the foregoing are almost universally constructed of
brick.</p>

<p>The dwelling-house for the owner or manager; to this is usually
attached a stable for the saddle-horses; the dwelling-houses are frequently
made of timber and mud.</p>

<p>The row of negro dwellings; which I have described in another
place as looking like neglected alms-houses in England, and is made
of the same materials as the house of the owner. From the appearance
of the negro huts an idea may usually be formed of the disposition
of the owner of a plantation. All these buildings are covered
with tiles.</p>

<p>The estates have no regular hospital for the sick negroes; but one
of the houses of the row is oftentimes set apart for this purpose.
The stocks in which disorderly slaves are placed, stand in the claying-house.</p>

<h3 class="p2">STOCK.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Of</span> those estates which I have seen, I think that the average
number of negroes sent to daily labour in the field does not reach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
forty for each; for although there may be upon a plantation this
number of males and females of a proper age for working, still some
of them will always be sick or employed upon errands, not directly
conducive to the advancement of the regular work. An estate which
possesses forty able negroes, males and females, an equal number of
oxen<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a>, and the same of horses, can be very well worked; and if the
lands are good, that is, if there is a fair proportion of low and high
lands fit for the culture of the sugar-cane, such an estate ought to
produce a number of chests of sugar of fifteen hundred weight each,
equal to that of the able slaves. I speak of forty slaves being sufficient,
because some descriptions of work are oftentimes performed
by freemen; thus, for instance, the sugar boilers, the person who clays
the sugar, the distiller, the cartmen, and even some others are very frequently
free. Only a very small proportion of the sugar will be muscavado,
if the business is conducted with any degree of management.
I have heard it said by many planters that the melasses will pay almost
every expence; and that if rum is made, the proceeds of the melasses
are rendered fully equal to the usual yearly expenditure.</p>

<p>The negroes may be valued at 32<i>l.</i> each; oxen at 3<i>l.</i> each; and
horses at the same; but by management the two last may be obtained
at lower prices. A sugar plantation of the first class,
with suitable buildings, may be reckoned as being worth from 7000<i>l.</i>
to 8000<i>l.</i> and some few are valued as high as 10,000<i>l.</i>; but an advance
of one-sixth of the price would probably be accepted, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
remainder to be paid by yearly instalments. The inland plantations
may be reckoned at from 3000<i>l.</i> to 5000<i>l.</i> and a few are rather
higher; but a smaller advance would be required than upon the purchase
of prime plantations, and the instalments would be more
moderate. Plantations of the first class ought to have eighty negroes
at least, and an increased number of animals, owing to their capability
of employing more hands.<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a></p>

<p>The only carts which are used upon the plantations are very clumsily
made; a flat surface or table (<i>meza</i>) made of thick and heavy
timber, of about two feet and a half broad, and six feet in length, is
fixed upon two wheels of solid timber, with a moveable axle-tree; a
pole is likewise fixed to the cart. These vehicles are always drawn
by four oxen or more, and as they are narrow, and the roads upon
which they must travel are bad, they are continually overturning.
The negroes who drive the carts have generally some indulgencies,
with which their fellow-slaves are not favoured, from the greater
labour which this business requires, and from the continual difficulty
and danger to which they are exposed, owing to the overturning
of the carts and the unruliness of the oxen. In the whole
management of the concerns of a plantation, the want of mechanical
assistance to decrease the labour of the workmen must strike every
person who is in the habit of seeing them, and of paying any attention
to the subject. I will mention one instance; when bricks or
tiles are to be removed from one place to another, the whole gang of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
negroes belonging to the estate is employed in carrying them; each
man takes three or perhaps four bricks or tiles upon his head, and
marches off gently and quietly; he lays them down where he is
desired so to do, and again returns for three or four more. Thus
thirty persons sometimes pass the whole day in doing the same
quantity of work that two men with wheel-barrows would have performed
with equal ease in the same space of time.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XVII.</h2>

<p class="pch">AGRICULTURE.&mdash;COTTON.</p>

<p class="drop-cap03">THIS most valuable plant has now become of more importance to
Pernambuco even than the sugar-cane, owing to the great demand
for the cotton of that province, and of those adjoining to it, in
the British markets. New establishments are forming yearly for the
cultivation of the cotton plant, notwithstanding the great inconveniences
which must often be experienced in accomplishing
this object. The districts which are chosen for the purpose, and
universally allowed to be the best adapted to its growth, are far removed
from the sea coast, arid and oftentimes very scantily supplied
with fresh water. Absolute distress is felt from a want of
water in some of these situations, at the time that other parts of the
country are enjoying perfect ease in this respect. The opinion is
very general that the cotton plant will not thrive in the neighbourhood
of the coast<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a>, and that frequent changes of weather are injurrious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
to it. The dry and wet seasons are doubtless more regularly
marked at a distance from the sea, and if any variation is felt in such
situations, it is from a want of rain, and not from a superabundance
of it. The cotton plant requires that a great portion of the year
should be dry; for if much rain falls when the pod is open, the wool
is lost; it becomes yellow, decays, and is rendered completely unfit
for use. The soil which is preferred for its culture is a deep red
earth, with veins of yellow occasionally running through it; this becomes
extremely hard, after a long interval without rain. The cotton
plantations are yearly receding farther into the interior, where-ever
the Sertam plains do not prevent this recession. The plantations
of this description which were formerly established nearer to the
coast, are now employed in the rearing of other plants. The constant
supply of new lands which the cotton plant requires, for it is
judged necessary to allow the land to rest for several years before it
undergoes cultivation a second time, may in some degree account
for this. Perhaps too, the rapid increase of the population upon the
coast may have had some effect in forcing back those who plant an
article of trade, to give place to others who cultivate the necessary
food for the inhabitants of the country. The cotton is often sold by
the planter in <i>caroço</i>, that is, before it has been separated from the
seed, to other persons whose livelihood is obtained in preparing it
for the export market; but as the labour of conveyance is, of course,
considerably increased whilst it is in this state, the dealers
establish themselves near to the plantations; they recede as the
planters recede. Some years ago a number of the machines for separating
the cotton from the seed were to be seen within two leagues of
Recife; a few years after they were removed to Goiana, and now
the principal resorts of the dealers are Limoeiro and Bom Jardim;
places, as will have been seen, which are several leagues distant from
the coast.</p>

<p>The lands are cleared for planting cotton in the usual manner,&mdash;by
cutting down the trees and burning them; and the holes for the
seeds are dug in quadrangular form at the distance of six feet from
each other. Three seeds are usually put into each hole; in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
British colonies, it is found necessary to make use of eight or ten
seeds. The time for planting is in January, after the <i>primeiras aguas</i>
or first waters; or at any rate as soon in the year as any rain has fallen.
Maize is usually planted among the cotton shrubs. Three crops and
sometimes four are obtained from the same plants; but the second
crop is that which generally produces the finest wool. The shrub
has a pleasing appearance whilst it is in full leaf, and is covered with
its most beautiful yellow blossoms; but when the pods begin to open
and the leaves to wither, its thin and straggling branches are left uncovered,
and the plant much resembles a large black currant bush,
that has been left unpruned for a length of time. The cotton is
gathered in nine or ten months. The machine for detaching it from
the seed is simple, and might be rendered still more so. Two small
rollers are placed horizontally in a frame, and nearly touching each
other. At each end of these rollers there are grooves through which
a cord runs, which is connected at the distance of a few yards with a
large wheel, to which handles are fixed, and this is turned by two
persons. The rollers are so formed as to turn in opposite directions,
so that as the cotton is thrust against them with the hand, it is
carried to the other side, but the seeds remain, for the opening between
the rollers is not sufficiently broad to allow them to pass<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a>.
The machine which is used in the British colonies seems to be of the
same construction in the main, but it is still more simple, for the
rollers are made to turn by means of the feet of the person who holds
the cotton to them<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a>. After it has undergone the above process,
some particles of seeds which have been accidentally broken still
remain, and of other substances which must be removed. For this
purpose a heap of cotton is made, and is beaten with large sticks;
this is a most injurious operation, by which the fibre is broken; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
as the value of the commodity to the manufacturer chiefly depends
upon the length of the fibre, no trouble ought to be grudged to avoid
this practice.</p>

<p>The seeds adhere “firmly to each other in the pod.” Mr. Edwards
speaks of this species in the British colonies, and gives to it the name
of kidney cotton, saying that he believes it to be “the true cotton of
Brazil<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a>.” The yellow or nankeen cotton is likewise to be found at
Pernambuco; but it does not form an article of cultivation, being
regarded rather as a curiosity. I have seen some species of wild
cotton, of which however as I have neither note nor specimen, I
cannot pretend to give a description.</p>

<p>The profits which are obtained in favourable years by the planters
of cotton, are enormous; but frequently disappointments are experienced.
Oftentimes a whole crop is totally lost, and instead of large
returns, the year proves entirely unproductive; or after a fair promise,
the grub, the caterpillar, the rain or the excessive drought
destroys all hope until the following season. The other great agricultural
object,&mdash;the sugar-cane, is not subject to these numerous and
ruinous reverses; for even if the year is unfavourable, at least enough
to pay the expences may be expected. I have heard it urged that
the market is very little affected by the supposed failure of a crop;
but it must be remembered that in a country of such vast
extent, one quarter may escape all mishap, whilst another is unfortunate.<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a></p>

<p>The quality of the cotton which is produced in South America,
either to the north or south of Pernambuco, is inferior to that of the
province of which I am treating. The cotton of Seara is not so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
good, and the cotton of Maranham is still coarser. Cotton is the
staple commodity of both these ports. Proceeding from Pernambuco
to the south, the cotton of Bahia is not so fine, and the small
quantity which is produced at Rio de Janeiro is not so good as that
of Bahia.</p>

<p>In treating of sugar and cotton, I have stated the chief points in
which the planters in the Columbian islands and those of Brazil
principally differ. Those of my readers to whom this subject is particularly
interesting may be referred to the well known work which
I have consulted.<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a></p>

<h3 class="p2">THE MANDIOC PLANTS.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> mandioc requires good land, and the same spot will not produce
two crops successively; it must be allowed to rest for one or
two years or more. The operation of planting it is simple, and
differs in no respect from that which was practised formerly by the
Indians<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a>. The flour which is made from this root is called <i>farinha
de pao</i>, or stick flour<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a>. There are several species of the mandioc<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
plant, of which some are adapted to high lands, and others to low and
moist situations; but when the plant is cultivated upon the latter, hillocks
must be raised, else the root would decay. Cattle are fed
upon the root and stalk: these are first prepared by being cut
into small pieces and exposed to the sun for several hours; if this
was not done, the food would be injurious to them. I have however
seen some of the draught oxen that have become so habituated
to it as to eat the root quite fresh, without receiving any apparent
injury;&mdash;in the manner that the human body becomes callous to the
most violent medicines by long custom.</p>

<p>I had in my possession, whilst I resided at Jaguaribe, one of these
animals, who generally once in the course of every week at least
contrived to get out of the inclosure, and pass part of the night in
some neighbouring mandioc ground. He was so dexterous in tearing
up the stalk with the root attached to it, that the marks of his
footsteps alone made us quite confident of the nature of the thief.
Whilst I was at Itamaraca, I lost a sheep, which had drank of the
juice of the mandioc. The negroes and other persons were making
<i>farinha</i>, and a trough stood under the press for the purpose of receiving
the juice. The sheep were attempting to come under the
shed for the purpose of reaching some of the roots, of which they
are extremely fond; one of them approached the trough, which was
filled with the juice, and although it was almost immediately perceived
and driven away, still the effect of the small quantity which
had been taken began to shew itself in a very few minutes;&mdash;the
animal tottered and fell, rising again, and again falling. Oil was
poured down its throat in considerable quantities, but to no purpose.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
The body swelled to an enormous size, and the animal was dead in
about ten minutes after it had drank of the juice.<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a></p>

<p>The insect which is mentioned by Piso (quoted by Mr. Southey)
under the name of <i>tapuru</i>, and is said to be generated by the juice
of the mandioc, after it has become putrid, I have often seen. It is
still known under the same name, which however is not peculiar to this
worm, but it is likewise applied to maggots of every kind. The juice
is not kept for any purpose, but it remains in the trough occasionally
for some days, owing to the carelessness of the person under whose
care these things are placed<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a>. Of the deadly nature of this worm
I never heard any mention. The species of mandioc which is called
<i>manipeba</i> is prohibited, owing to the greater activity of its poisonous
juice, and it is now almost extirpated; it had the advantage of greater
durability under ground. Those kinds which are usually planted
decay if the stalk is broken off, but the stalks of the <i>manipeba</i> may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
be cut away, and the root will still continue sound until, on the following
year a new stalk springs up. I have heard it said, that in
the dry soils of the Mata a few of the other varieties of this
plant will allow of the same treatment. Although the mandioc plant
requires a dry situation, still when the rains fail in January the crops
fall short, for it is in this month, immediately after the first waters,
that the principal plantations of it are made. The Brazilians have a
peculiar name for each part of this plant; the root is called <i>mandioca</i>,
the stalk <i>maniva</i>, the leaves <i>manisoba</i>, and the juice <i>manipueira</i>.
There is one species of the plant, of which the juice is harmless; it
bears the name of <i>macaxeira</i>. Its root never grows to a great size,
and it is therefore rather planted as an article of luxury than as
regular food. From this species less juice is extracted than from the
roots of equal dimensions of any of the other kinds of mandioc<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a>.
The rind of those species of mandioc which are in general use is of a
dark brown colour, but there is one kind of which the rind is white.</p>

<p>The most expensive part of the process of making the flour of
the mandioc, consists in disengaging the rind from the root; this is
done with difficulty, by means of a piece of a broken blunt knife, a
sharp pebble, or a small shell, with one of which each person is supplied;
in this work a considerable number of persons must be occupied,
to furnish employment to the wheel which grinds the root.
This wheel is placed in a frame, and a handle is fixed to it on each
side, by which it may be turned by two men, one of them working at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
each of the handles. A trough stands under the wheel, and the wheel
is cased in copper, which is made rough by means of holes punched in
it, the sides of the holes are not filed smooth. The mandioc is thrust
against the wheel whilst it is turned with great velocity, and being by
this means ground it falls into the trough underneath. From hence
the ground pulp is put into a press, that the juice may be extracted;
and after it has undergone sufficient pressure this pulp or paste (<i>maça</i>)
is removed on to a hot hearth, upon which a person is employed to
keep it in continual motion, that it may not be burnt; when quite
crisp it is taken off the hearth, and on being suffered to cool is in
a state to be made use of.<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a></p>

<p>There is another mode of preparing the mandioc for food; it is put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
into water in a pannier or closed basket, and is allowed to remain
there for some days, until the root becomes soft, from which the
mandioc, when in this state, is called <i>mandioca molle</i>. It is prepared
in this manner for the purpose of making cakes, &amp;c. but not generally,
for food. I tried to introduce the <i>farinha</i>, made from steeped
mandioc, among the slaves whilst I resided at Jaguaribe; the flour
which was made from it, was much finer than that which is obtained
in the usual manner, but the negroes did not like it so well, and I
did not think it wholesome for them on consideration, and therefore
the old way was continued. The mandioc must have made a certain
advance towards putrefaction before it becomes sufficiently soft
to be bruised, and this cannot fail I should suppose to be injurious.
The smell from the <i>mandioca molle</i> is extremely offensive, and is one of
the annoyances in walking the streets of Recife, in which it is sold.
The smell is however entirely removed after the <i>farinha</i> has been
for some minutes upon the oven.<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a></p>

<h3 class="p2">THE COCO-TREE.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> sandy soils of the coast in which this plant seems to delight
would, if they were not cultivated with it, remain almost useless; but
from the produce which the coco-tree yields, they are rendered very
valuable. The lands which are occupied by this plant alone yield
a settled income to the owners of them without much labour; whilst<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
the cultivation of any other requires considerable toil; however the
long period, of from five to seven years, which the tree requires
before it bears fruit, cannot fail to be considered as a drawback
upon the profits which it ultimately affords, and upon the great age
to which it arrives. However perhaps there are few trees of equal size
that yield fruit in so short a period. It is a most valuable production,
of which every part is appropriated to some useful purpose. The Brazilians
say, that it affords to them both food and shelter; of the trunk
and of the leaves their huts are built; of its fibrous roots baskets are
made, and cordage of the outward husk. Its fruit renders to them
meat and drink, and an excellent oil is likewise to be obtained
by skimming the juice which may be pressed from the pulp. The
coco is in general use in cookery among all ranks of people, and it
forms one of the chief articles of internal trade<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a>. When a plantation
of this tree is about to be established, the ripe cocos from which
the plants are to be reared, are placed in the ground, about twelve
inches below the surface, in long and almost united rows, for the
convenience of being watered. They are frequently placed in this
manner, under the eaves of houses, which saves much trouble, for by
the accumulation of water from the house top, each shower of rain produces
sufficient moisture, and the owner is relieved from any farther
trouble in this respect. At the expiration of five months the shoots
begin to make their appearance above ground, and at the end of
twelve months from the time that the cocos were first put into the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>earth, the young plants may be removed<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a>. They are then placed
at the distance of eight or ten yards from each other, upon the land
that has been cleared for the purpose of receiving them. As soon
as they have once taken root, and by far the major part of them
fail not so to do, very little care is necessary. They must however
be preserved tolerably free from brushwood, at least during the first
years; and indeed at all times the fruitfulness of the tree will be increased,
if it is allowed its due space.<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a></p>

<h3 class="p2">THE CARRAPATO OR CASTOR TREE.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> plant may be, as well as the coco, reared in sandy soils, but
it will flourish with more luxuriance, upon those that are of a richer
kind. The oil, which is extracted from the seed, is in general use
for lamps and other purposes, but neither is it eaten, nor known as
a medicine; but it is administered as an outward application. It is
given to animals that have drank the juice of the mandioc, and is
sometimes successful in forcing the poison back from the stomach.
The plant is much cultivated, but it is frequently to be seen growing

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> wood from which is extracted the beautiful red dye, which
is so much esteemed in Europe, is, I believe, generally supposed
to be peculiar<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> to the country to which it has given a name<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a>.
It is often called in Pernambuco (from whence, I imagine, that it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
exclusively exported) <i>pao da Rainha</i> or Queen’s wood, owing to
the circumstance of the trade in it being a government monopoly;
and it is exported to Europe on account of the Crown. No
care has been taken to prevent a scarcity of the wood, and indeed
its ultimate extirpation; it is cut down unmercifully wherever
it is met with by the officers who are appointed for this purpose,
without any regard being paid to the size of the tree.
No plantations have been formed of it, and consequently it is now
rarely to be seen, within many leagues of the coast. The labour which
is required in obtaining it is now considerable, for the weight of the
wood renders its conveyance very difficult upon the backs of horses,
and this is the only manner in which it can be carried. The pay which
is given by the government to the carriers is below the usual rate for
work equally laborious, and therefore a wide source of oppression
is afforded. The carrier receives with his load a slip of paper,
declaring the weight of the wood which he is conveying; this is to
be presented by him at the <i>Intendencia da Marinha</i>, or dock-yard at
Recife, and he must wait until the wood is again weighed and the
paper countersigned, before he can return home. These men are
delayed sometimes for several days, before they are permitted to return;
and they find that it is their interest to make many presents
to the inferior officers, that they may be quickly dispatched. Here
the old system of indifference to what is just, still most glaringly
continues. This account of the treatment of the men who convey
the wood, I received from several who had been employed in the
business.</p>

<p>If the trade in the wood was to be laid open, it would only tend
to its scarcity still more speedily than under the existing system;
but as soon as it became scarce it would be rendered an object
worthy of cultivation: however, as long as it is to be obtained in
its wild state, and enormous profits can be made, the government
will probably continue to supply the market on their own account.
Every sugar plantation might cultivate a great number of these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
trees, without any additional land being required to be cleared for
the purpose of planting them. The fences of the <i>Cercados</i>, or fields,
might be strengthened by the addition of the Brazil inserted at intervals;
instead of other trees being used in this way.</p>

<p>I never saw the plant, but I have heard it described in the following
manner. It is not a lofty tree; and at a short distance from the
ground, innumerable branches spring forth and extend in every
direction in a straggling, irregular, and unpleasing manner. Practice
is requisite to obtain a knowledge of the tree, for the valuable
portion of it is the heart, and the outward coat of wood has not any
peculiarity. The leaves are small, and never cover the branches luxuriantly.<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Tatajuba</span>, or <span class="smcap">Fustic</span>.&mdash;This is a species of wood producing
a yellow dye, which is well known in England. It is of spontaneous
growth. A demand has lately been made for it, and destruction has
followed wherever the plant can be met with.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Feijam</span> or <span class="smcap">Kidney Bean</span> is planted in April and May with
the mandioc. It is much used in the neighbourhood of the coast by
the free part of the population, but is not produced in sufficient
quantities to form a common food for the negroes. When it is
cooked with the juice of the pulp of the coco-nut it makes a most
excellent dish. In the cotton districts it forms one of the chief
articles of the negroes’ food.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Milho</span>, or <span class="smcap">Maize</span>, is planted with mandioc, and sometimes in
the cane fields; but as the best crop is obtained by planting it with
the mandioc in January, few persons sow it at any other time. In
the inland districts it is sown with the cotton, and in such situations
yields more plentifully than in the lands which border upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
coast. Boiled maize is a common breakfast for the slaves in
the cotton districts; the dish resembles thick peas’ soup, and is far
from being unpalatable if sugar or treacle is added. The people
call it <i>angu de milho</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Banana Plant</span> is too well known to take up much space
here. There are in Pernambuco three species of it; the <i>banana
curta</i> or short banana; this is a small fruit, not exceeding two inches
in length;&mdash;the <i>banana comprida</i> or long banana, which is the
plantain;&mdash;and lately the third species has been introduced, and has
obtained the strange name of the <i>banana de quatro vintems</i> or four
<i>vintems</i> banana, because the clusters of the fruit are so large that each
cluster may be sold for four <i>vintems</i>,&mdash;rather more than 5<i>d.</i> I do not
think that as much utility is derived from the plant as it is capable
of affording; it is not so generally used as a food by the negroes, as
it ought to be. The <i>banana curta</i>, with dry <i>farinha</i>, is a common
breakfast among people of colour.<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Batatas.</span>&mdash;Of these there are several species; but that which
I had the most opportunities of seeing was the <i>batata roxa</i> or purple
potatoe, which is so called from the purple tinge of the pulp after it has
been boiled; this is the best of the tribe. The taste is pleasant, and
would be still more so if it was not rather sweet. The <i>batata</i> is a
creeping plant, and is re-produced from the roots, or from the sprouts
of the branches. If the branches of roots that have been pulled up
remain upon the ground, and a shower of rain falls soon after they
have been broken off, their vegetation will recommence. The <i>batatas</i>
are at present planted more as a luxury for the planter’s house than
as food for the negroes; but I do not think that there is any plant
which is more capable, or even so capable, of affording assistance to
the mandioc as this; and perhaps it might supply its place. The
mandioc should be supplanted, if any thing else could be discovered
to answer the purpose of a staple article of food; for it is uncertain
in yielding its crops, and requires the best land. To neither of
these disadvantages would, I rather think, the <i>batata</i> be found subject.
The European potatoe has been planted, in several instances, at Pernambuco;
the first crop is as well tasted as the roots from which it
was produced, but the potatoes were small; a second crop, being
obtained from the same family of roots, has been sweetish, and on
advancing, the potatoes become still more similar to the <i>batata</i> of
the country<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a>. Yet the plants appear to be totally different from
each other, for the Brazil <i>batata</i> or potatoe is produced from a creeper.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tobacco</span> is planted upon almost all the sugar-plantations, and by
a majority of persons of the lower classes, for their own use. A
considerable quantity is imported from the southern provinces of
Brazil into Pernambuco. The ants do not molest the plant, but in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
the parts of the country which are much infested by these insects, the
peasants mix the seed of the tobacco with wood ashes before they
strew with it the ground which they are about to sow. The ants
have an antipathy to the ashes, and thus the seed is preserved.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rice</span> is very little cultivated in Pernambuco; but at Maranham
it forms the second object of trade. The use of it in Pernambuco is
inconsiderable, from the idea that it is unwholesome for the negroes;
and indeed I never met with any of the Africans who preferred it to
other kinds of food.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Coffee</span> and <span class="smcap">Cacao</span> are yet planted as experiments, for their introduction
into Pernambuco is recent.<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ipecacuanha.</span>&mdash;Although this is at present only to be found in a
wild state, I have inserted it here, for it must shortly take its place
among cultivated plants. The small quantity exported is procured by
the Indians and other persons of the same rank and habits of life,
in the thickest woods. It thrives most in the shade. The plant is
destroyed also by many of the larger kinds of game, to which it serves
as food. There are two species of it which are distinguished by the
names of white and black Ipecacuanha; the latter is that which is used
for medicinal purposes in Europe<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a>. The white is used by the Brazilians
in colds and coughs, and is taken to purify the blood after a
fever.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ginger</span> is indigenous, but is now rarely to be found in a wild
state<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a>. The white ginger is that which is in general use.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Malagueta Pepper</span> is a small shrub which is to be seen under the
eaves of almost every cottage. The pods are of a bright scarlet
colour, of about one inch in length, and one quarter in breadth. It
is a hardy plant; for although it droops under excessive drought, it
is seldom destroyed by it. Often are to be seen at the same time,
and upon the same bush, the blossoms, and the green and the ripe
scarlet pods. Wherever this shrub springs up care is taken of it;
for the people of all ranks are from habit almost unable to eat their
food without the <i>malagueta</i>. The pods are bruised when about to
be used, and either form an ingredient in every dish, or they are
served up in all the sauces<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a>. The <i>pimenta de cheiro</i>, or scented
pepper, is likewise common, but it requires more care in rearing,
and is a smaller shrub than the <i>malagueta</i>. The pods are of a bright
red in general, but sometimes they are, naturally, of a pale yellow
colour; they are round, and about the size of a crab apple.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tea</span> is stated to be indigenous in Brazil<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a>. A priest of considerable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
reputation as a botanist, told me that he had discovered
this plant in the neighbourhood of Olinda; but afterwards again he
informed me that he was afraid he had been too sanguine.<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horticulture</span> has of late years been rapidly improving, and the
markets of Recife are now well supplied with vegetables and roots.
The gardeners are chiefly Portugueze, from the provinces of the
mother country, or from the Azores. Peas<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a>, cabbages, and several
other kinds of European vegetables and roots are to be purchased,
besides others which are peculiar to the country, such as <i>mandubims</i>
and yams. The European onion produces a small root of an oblong
form<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a>, which is known in Pernambuco under the name of <i>cebolinho</i>,
as the diminutive of <i>cebola</i>, an onion. The vine is to be seen in
many of the gardens in the neighbourhood of Recife and of Olinda;
and formerly there were a great many at Conception upon the island
of Itamaraca, but few now remain. No wine is made. The fruit
trees are some of those which are common to the southern parts of
Europe, such as the orange<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a>, the fig, and others, but no olives;
besides these, there are the manga, the jack, and a numerous list,
some of which have been mentioned incidentally in the course of
this volume; but I have tarried already too long upon this branch
of my subject, and must now proceed to something else.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>

<p class="pch">THE FREE POPULATION.</p>

<p class="drop-cap03">THE insufficiency of the population of Portugal to the almost
unbounded plans of the rulers of that kingdom, has, in all probability,
saved her South American possessions from the dreadful
contests which are to be apprehended in the neighbouring Spanish
colonies, between the Creole white inhabitants and those of colour.
The struggle yet rages with exterminating violence between the
descendants of Europeans, born in South America, and the natives
of Old Spain; but when this is at an end, another equally, if not
more destructive, is to be looked for between the former and their
countrymen of mixed casts. The appeal which the creole whites
have made to the people, and the declarations which they have
publicly set forth, of directing their proceedings by their voice; the
exposure of those abstract principles of government which are so
delightful in theory, but so difficult of execution, will, most probably,
bring down upon their heads the destruction which has thus
been courted. In the Portugueze South American dominions, circumstances
have directed that there should be no division of casts,
and very few of those degrading and most galling distinctions which
have been made by all other nations in the management of their
colonies. That this was not intended by the mother country, but
was rather submitted to from necessity, is to be discovered in some
few regulations, which plainly shew, that if Portugal could have preserved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
the superiority of the whites, she would, as well as her neighbours,
have established laws for this purpose. The rulers of Portugal
wished to colonize to an unlimited extent; but their country
did not possess a population sufficiently numerous for their magnificent
plans. Adventurers left their own country to settle in the New
World, who were literally adventurers; for they had not any settled
plans of life, and they were without families. Persons of established
habits, who had the wish to follow any of the ordinary means of
gaining a livelihood, found employment at home; neither could
Portugal spare them, nor did they wish to leave their native soil.
There was no superabundance of population, and therefore every man
might find occupation at home, if he had steadiness to look for it;
there was no division in political or religious opinion; there was no
necessity for emigration, save that which was urged by crimes.
Thus the generality of the men who embarked in the expeditions
which were fitted out for Brazil, were unaccompanied by females,
and therefore, naturally, on their arrival in that country, they married,
or irregularly connected themselves with Indian women, and
subsequently with those of Africa. It is true that orphan girls were
sent out by the government of Portugal<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a>, but these were necessarily
few in number. In the course of another generation, the colonists married
the women of mixed casts, owing to the impossibility of obtaining
those of their own colour; and the frequency of the custom, and
the silence of the laws upon the subject, removed all idea of degradation,
in thus connecting themselves. Still the European notions
of superiority were not entirely laid aside, and these caused the
passing of some regulations, by which white persons were to enjoy
certain privileges. Thus, although the form of trial for all casts is
the same, in certain places only can capital punishments be inflicted
upon the favoured race; the people of colour are not eligible to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
some of the chief offices of government, nor can they become members
of the priesthood.</p>

<p>From the mildness of the laws, however, the mixed casts have
gained ground considerably; the regulations which exist against
them are evaded, or rather they have become obsolete. Perhaps the
heroic conduct of Camaram and Henrique Dias, the Indian and
negro chieftains, in the famous and most interesting contest between
the Pernambucans and the Dutch, and the honours subsequently
granted by the crown of Portugal to both of them, may
have led to the exaltation of the general character of the much-injured
varieties of the human species of which they were members.
Familiarity between the chieftains of the several corps
must be the consequence of their embarkation in the same cause,
when the war is one of skirmishes, of ambuscades, of continual
alarm, of assistance constantly afforded to each other; a patriotic
war, against a foreign invader, in which difference of religion
exists, and each party mortally hates the other. On these occasions
all men are equal, or he only is superior whose strength and whose
activity surpasses that of others. The amalgamation of casts
which is caused by this consciousness of equality could not have
had a fairer field for its full accomplishment, than the war to which
I have alluded; and the friendships which were formed under these
circumstances would not easily be broken off. Although the parties
who had been so united might have been, in their situations in
life very far removed from each other, still the participation of
equal danger must render dear the companions in peril, and make
the feelings which had been roused on these occasions of long
duration; they would continue to act, long after the cessation of
the series of occurrences which had called them forth.</p>

<p>The free population of Brazil at the present time consists of
Europeans; Brazilians, that is, white persons born in Brazil; mulattos,
that is, the mixed cast between the whites and blacks, and
all the varieties into which it can branch; mamalucos, that is, the
mixed cast between the whites and Indians, and all its varieties;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
Indians in a domesticated state, who are called generally Caboclos;
and those who still remain in a savage state, and are called generally
Tapuyas; negroes born in Brazil, and manumitted Africans;
lastly, Mestizos, that is, the mixed cast between the Indians and
negroes. Of slaves, I shall speak by and by more at large; these
are Africans, creole negroes, mulattos, and mestizos. The maxim
of the civil law, <i>partus sequitur ventrem</i>, is in force here as well as in
the colonies of other nations.<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a></p>

<p>These several mixtures of the human race have their shades of difference
of character as well as of colour. First we must treat of the
whites. The Europeans who are not in office, or who are not military
men, are, generally speaking, adventurers who have arrived
in that country with little or no capital. These men commence
their career in low situations of life, but by parsimony and continual
exertion directed to one end, that of amassing money, they often
attain their object, and pass the evening of their lives in opulence.
These habits fail not, oftentimes, to give a bias to their dispositions,
which is unallied to generosity and liberality. They look down
upon the Brazilians, or rather they wish to consider themselves
superior to them; and until lately the government took no pains
to remove the jealousy which existed between the two descriptions of
white persons; and even now, not so much attention is paid to the
subject as its great importance seems to require.<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span></p>

<p>The Brazilian white man of large property, who draws his descent
from the first Donatory of a province, or whose family has for
some generations enjoyed distinction, entertains a high opinion of
his own importance, which may sometimes appear ridiculous; but
which much oftener leads him to acts of generosity,&mdash;to the adoption
of liberal ideas,&mdash;to honourable conduct. If he has been well
educated, and has had the good fortune to have been instructed by a
priest whose ideas are enlightened, who gives a proper latitude for
difference of opinion, who tolerates as he is tolerated, then the character
of a young Brazilian exhibits much to admire. Surrounded
by numerous relatives, and by his immediate dependants, living in
a vast and half-civilized country, he is endued with much independence
of language and behaviour, which are softened by the
subordination which has been imbibed during his course of education.
That this is general, I pretend not to say; few persons are
instructed in a proper manner, and again, few are those who profit
by the education which they have received; but more numerous
are the individuals who now undergo necessary tuition, for powerful
motives have arisen to urge the attainment of knowledge.</p>

<p>I have heard it often observed, and I cannot help saying that I
think some truth is to be attached to the remark, in the country of
which I am treating, that women are usually less lenient to their
slaves than men, but this doubtless proceeds from the ignorant state
in which they are brought up; they scarcely receive any education,
and have not the advantages of obtaining instruction from communication
with persons who are unconnected with their own way of
life; of imbibing new ideas from general conversation. They are
born, bred, and continue surrounded by slaves without receiving any
check, with high notions of superiority, without any thought that what
they do is wrong. Bring these women forwards, educate them, treat
them as rational, as equal beings, and they will be in no respect inferior
to their countrymen; the fault is not with the sex, but in the
state of the human being. As soon as a child begins to crawl, a
slave of about its own age and of the same sex is given to it as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
playfellow, or rather as a plaything; they grow up together, and
the slave is made the stock upon which the young owner gives vent
to passion; the slave is sent upon all errands, and receives the
blame of all unfortunate accidents;&mdash;in fact, the white child is thus
encouraged to be overbearing, owing to the false fondness of its parents.
Upon the boys the effect is less visible in after-life, because
the world curbs and checks them, but the girls do not stir from
home, and therefore have no opportunities of wearing off these pernicious
habits. It is only surprising that so many excellent women
should be found among them, and by no means strange that the
disposition of some of them should be injured by this unfortunate
direction of their infant years.</p>

<p>As vegetation rapidly advances in such climates, so the animal
sooner arrives at maturity than in those of less genial warmth; and
here again education is rendered doubly necessary to lead the mind
to new ideas, to curb the passions, to give a sense of honour, and
to instil feelings of that species of pride which is so necessary to a
becoming line of conduct. The state of society, the climate, and
the celibacy of the numerous priesthood, cause the number of illegitimate
children to be very great; but here the <i>roda dos engeitados</i>, and a
custom which shews the natural goodness of the people, prevent the
frequent occurrence of infanticide, or rather render it almost unknown.
An infant is frequently during the night laid at the door of a rich
person, and on being discovered in the morning is taken in, and is
almost invariably allowed to remain; it is brought up with the children
of the house (if its colour is not too dark to admit of this,) certainly
as a dependant, but not as a servant; however a considerable
tinge of colour will not prevent it from being reared with the white
children. These <i>engeitados</i> or rejected ones, as individuals who are
so circumstanced are called, are frequently to be met with, and
I heard of few exceptions to the general kindness with which they
are treated. Public feeling is much against the refusing to accept
and rear an <i>engeitado</i>; the owner of a house, who is in easy circumstances,
and yet sends the infant from his own door to the public<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
institution which is provided for its reception, is generally spoken
of in terms of indignation. Sometimes a poor man will find one of
these presents at his door, and he will generally place it at the
landholder’s threshold on the following night; this is accounted excusable
and even meritorious, for at the Great House the child has
nearly a certainty of being well taken care of.</p>

<p>I have observed that, generally speaking, Europeans are less indulgent
to their slaves than Brazilians; the former feed them well,
but they require from the poor wretches more labour than they can
perform, whilst the latter allow the affairs of their estates to continue
in the way in which it has been accustomed to be directed. This
difference between the two descriptions of owners is easily accounted
for; the European has probably purchased part of his slaves on
credit, and has during the whole course of his life made the accumulation
of riches his chief object. The Brazilian inherits his estate,
and as nothing urges him to the necessity of obtaining large profits,
he continues the course that has been pointed out to him by the
former possessors. His habits of quietude and indolence have led
him to be easy and indifferent, and although he may not provide for
the maintenance of his slaves with so much care as the European,
still they find more time to seek for food themselves. That avaricious
spirit which deliberately works a man or a brute animal<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> until
it is unfit for farther service, without any regard to the well-being of
the creature, which is thus treated as a mere machine, as if it was
formed of wood or iron, is however seldom to be met with in those
parts of the country which I visited. Instances of cruelty occur (as
has been, and will yet be seen,) but these proceed from individual
depravity, and not from systematic, cold-blooded, calculating indifference
to the means by which a desired end is to be compassed.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the relationship of the mulattos on one side to
the black race, they consider themselves superior to the mamalucos;
they lean to the whites, and from the light in which the Indians are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
held, pride themselves upon being totally unconnected with them.
Still the mulattos are conscious of their connection with men who
are in a state of slavery, and that many persons even of their own
colour are under these degraded circumstances; they have therefore
always a feeling of inferiority in the company of white men, if these
white men are wealthy and powerful. This inferiority of rank is
not so much felt by white persons in the lower walks of life, and these
are more easily led to become familiar with individuals of their own
colour who are in wealthy circumstances. Still the inferiority which
the mulatto feels is more that which is produced by poverty than
that which his colour has caused, for he will be equally respectful
to a person of his own cast, who may happen to be rich<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a>. The degraded
state of the people of colour in the British colonies is most
lamentable<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a>. In Brazil, even the trifling regulations which exist
against them remain unattended to. A mulatto enters into holy
orders or is appointed a magistrate, his papers stating him to be a
white man, but his appearance plainly denoting the contrary. In
conversing on one occasion with a man of colour who was in my
service, I asked him if a certain <i>Capitam-mor</i> was not a mulatto
man; he answered, “he was, but is not now<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a>.” I begged him to explain,
when he added, “Can a <i>Capitam-mor</i> be a mulatto man<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a>?”
I was intimately acquainted with a priest, whose complexion and hair
plainly denoted from whence he drew his origin; I liked him much,
he was a well educated and intelligent man. Besides this individual
instance, I met with several others of the same description.</p>

<p>The regiments of militia which are called mulatto regiments, are
so named from all the officers and men being of mixed casts; nor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
can white persons be admitted into them. The principal officers
are men of property, and the colonel, like the commander of any
other regiment, is only amenable to the governor of the province.
In the white militia regiments, the officers ought to be by law white
men; but in practice they are rather reputed white men, for very
little pains are taken to prove that there is no mixture of blood.
Great numbers of the soldiers belonging to the regiments which are
officered by white men, are mulattos, and other persons of colour.
The regiments of the line, likewise, (as I have elsewhere said) admit
into the ranks all persons excepting negroes and Indians; but the
officers of these must prove nobility of birth; however, as certain
degrees of nobility have been conferred upon persons in whose
families there is much mixture of blood, this proof cannot be regarded
as being required against the mulatto or mamaluco part of
the population. Thus an European adventurer could not obtain a
commission in these regiments, whilst a Brazilian, whose family has
distinguished itself in the province in former times, will prove his
eligibility without regard to the blood which runs in his veins. He
is noble, let that flow from whence it may.<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a></p>

<p>The late colonel of the mulatto regiment of Recife, by name
Nogueira, went to Lisbon, and returned to Pernambuco with the
Order of Christ, which the Queen had conferred upon him<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a>. A
chief person of one of the provinces is the son of a white
man and a woman of colour; he has received an excellent education,
is of a generous disposition, and entertains most liberal views
upon all subjects. He has been made a colonel, and a degree of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
nobility has been conferred upon him; likewise the Regent is
sponsor to one of his children. Many other instances might be
mentioned. Thus has Portugal, of late years from policy, continued
that system into which she was led by her peculiar circumstances in
former times. Some of the wealthy planters of Pernambuco, and of
the rich inhabitants of Recife are men of colour. The major part
of the best mechanics are also of mixed blood.</p>

<p>It is said that mulattos make bad masters; and this holds good
oftentimes with persons of this description, who have been in a state
of slavery, and become possessed of slaves of their own, or are employed
as managers upon estates. The change of situation would
lead to the same consequences in any race of human beings, and
cannot be accounted peculiar to the mixed casts. I have seen mulattos
of free birth as kind, as lenient, and as forbearing to their
slaves and other dependants as any white man.</p>

<p>Marriages between white men and women of colour are by no
means rare, though they are sufficiently so to cause the circumstance
to be mentioned when speaking of an individual who has connected
himself in this manner; but this is not said with the intent
of lowering him in the estimation of others. Indeed the remark is
only made if the person is a planter of any importance, and the
woman is decidedly of dark colour, for even a considerable tinge will
pass for white; if the white man belongs to the lower orders, the
woman is not accounted as being unequal to him in rank, unless she
is nearly black. The European adventurers often marry in this
manner, which generally occurs when the woman has a dower.
The rich mulatto families are often glad to dispose of their daughters
to these men, although the person who has been fixed upon may be
in indifferent circumstances; for the colour of the children of their
daughters is bettered, and from the well-known prudence and regularity
of this set of men, a large fortune may be hoped for even from
very small beginnings. Whilst I was at Jaguaribe, I was in the
frequent habit of seeing a handsome young man, who was a native
of the island of St. Michael’s. This person happened to be with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
me on one occasion when the commandant from the Sertam was
staying at my house. The commandant asked him if he
could read and write, and being answered in the negative, said,
“then you will not do,” and turning to me, added, “I have a commission
from a friend of mine to take with me back to the Sertam a
good-looking young Portugueze of regular habits, who can read and
write, for the purpose of marrying him to his daughter.” These kind
of commissions (<i>encommendas</i>) are not unusual.</p>

<p>Still the Brazilians of high birth and large property do not like to
intermarry with persons whose mixture of blood is <i>very</i> apparent,
and hence arise peculiar circumstances. A man of this description
becomes attached to a woman of colour, connects himself with her,
and takes her to his home, where she is in a short time even visited
by married women; she governs his household affairs, acts and considers
herself as his wife, and frequently after the birth of several
children, when they are neither of them young, he marries her.
In connections of this nature, the parties are more truly attached than
in marriages between persons who belong to two families of the first
rank; for the latter are entered into from convenience rather than
from affection; indeed the parties, on some occasions, do not see
each other until a few days before the ceremony takes place. It
often occurs, that inclination, necessity, or convenience induce or
oblige a man to separate from the person with whom he has thus
been connected; in this case, he gives her a portion, and she marries
a man of her own rank, who regards her rather as a widow than as
one whose conduct has been incorrect. Instances of infidelity in
these women are rare; they become attached to the men with
whom they cohabit, and they direct the affairs of the houses over
which they are placed with the same zeal that they would display if
they had the right of command over them. It is greatly to the
credit of the people of that country that so much fidelity should be
shewn on one side, and that this should so frequently as it is, be
rewarded by the other party, in the advancement of those who have
behaved thus faithfully, to a respectable and acknowledged situation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
in society. It should be recollected too that the merit of moral feelings
must be judged of by the standard of the country, and not by
our own institutions. I have only spoken above of what occurs
among the planters; for in large towns man is pretty much the same
every where.</p>

<p>The Mamalucos are more frequently to be seen in the Sertam than
upon the coast. They are handsomer than the mulattos; and the
women of this cast particularly surpass in beauty all others of the
country; they have the brown tint of mulattos, but their features are
less blunt, and their hair is not curled. I do not think that the men
can be said to possess more courage than the mulattos; but whether
from the knowledge which they have of being of free birth on both
sides, or from residing in the interior of the country where government
is more loose, they appear to have more independence of character,
and to pay less deference to a white man than the mulattos.
When women relate any deed of danger that has been surmounted
or undertaken, they generally state that the chief actor in it was a
large mamaluco, <i>mamalucam</i>; as if they thought this description of men
to be superior to all others. Mamalucos may enter into the mulatto
regiments, and are pressed into the regiments of the line as being
men of colour, without any regard to the sources from which their
blood proceeds.</p>

<p>Of the domesticated Indians I have already elsewhere given what
accounts I could collect, and what I had opportunities of observing.
The wild Indians are now only to be met with at a great distance
from the coast of Pernambuco; and although they are very near to
Maranham, and are dreaded neighbours, I had no means of seeing
any of them.</p>

<p>I now proceed to mention that numerous and valuable race of
men, the creole negroes; a tree of African growth, which has thus
been transplanted, cultivated, and much improved by its removal to
the New World. The Creole negroes stand alone and unconnected
with every other race of men, and this circumstance alone would be
sufficient, and indeed contributes much to the effect of uniting them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
to each other. The mulattos, and all other persons of mixed blood
wish to lean towards the whites, if they can possibly lay any claim
to relationship. Even the mestizo tries to pass for a mulatto, and
to persuade himself and others that his veins contain some portion
of white blood, although that with which they are filled proceeds
from Indian and negro sources. Those only who can have no pretensions
to a mixture of blood, call themselves negroes, which renders
the individuals who do pass under this denomination, much
attached to each other, from the impossibility of being mistaken for
members of any other cast. They are of handsome persons, brave
and hardy, obedient to the whites, and willing to please; but they
are easily affronted, and the least allusion to their colour being made
by a person of a lighter tint, enrages them to a great degree; though
they will sometimes say, “a negro I am, but always upright”<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a>. They
are again distinct from their brethren in slavery, owing to their superior
situation as free men.</p>

<p>The free creole negroes have their exclusive regiments, as well as
the mulattos, of which every officer and soldier must be perfectly
black. There are two of these regiments for the province of Pernambuco,
which consist of indefinite numbers of men, who are
dispersed all over the country. These regiments are distinguished
from each other by the names of Old Henriques and New Henriques<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a>.
The name of Henriques is derived from the famous chieftain,
Henrique Diaz, in the time of the Dutch war. I have heard
some of the most intelligent of those with whom I have conversed,
speak in enthusiastic terms of the aid which he gave to the whites in
that struggle. I have seen some portion of one of these regiments,
in Recife, accompanying the procession of our Lady of the
Rosary, the patroness of negroes. They were dressed in white cloth
uniforms turned up with scarlet, and they looked very soldier-like.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
They were in tolerable discipline, and seemed to wish to go through
the duty of the day in the best manner that they were able; they
acted with an appearance of zeal and the desire of excelling. Those
of which I speak formed a finer body of men than any other soldiers
which I had an opportunity of seeing in that country. On gala
days the superior black officers in their white uniforms, pay their
respects to the governor, exactly in the same manner that the persons
of any other cast, holding commissions of equal rank are expected
to go through this form. These men receive no pay, so that
their neat appearance on such occasions bespeaks a certain degree of
wealth among them; neither are the privates nor any other persons belonging
to these regiments paid for their services. Some of the
whites rather ridicule the black officers, but not in their presence;
and the laugh which is raised against them is caused perhaps by a
lurking wish to prevent this insulted race from the display of those
distinctions which the government has wisely conceded to them, but
which hurt the European ideas of superiority. The old regiment
of Henriques was, at the time that I resided in Pernambuco, without
a colonel, and I heard much discussion on several occasions among
the Creole negroes, about the fittest person to be appointed to the
vacant situation.<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a></p>

<p>The creole negroes of Recife are, generally speaking, mechanics of
all descriptions; but they have not yet reached the higher ranks
of life, as gentlemen, as planters, and as merchants. Some of them
have accumulated considerable sums of money, and possess many
slaves, to whom they teach their own trade, or these slaves are taught
other mechanical employments by which they may become useful.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
They work for their owners, and render to them great profits, for
every description of labour is high, and that which requires any degree
of skill bears even a higher comparative value than the departments
of which a knowledge is more easily attained. The best
church and image painter of Pernambuco is a black man, who has
good manners, and quite the air of a man of some importance, though
he does not by any means assume too much. The negroes are excluded
from the priesthood<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a>; and from the offices which the mulattos
may obtain through their evasion of the law, but which the decided
and unequivocal colour of the negro entirely precludes him from aspiring
to. In law all persons who are not white, and are born free,
class equally; manumitted slaves are placed upon the same footing as
persons born free. However, although the few exclusions which exist
against the negroes are degrading, still in some instances they are
befriended by them. They are unable, owing to their colour, to
serve in the regiments of the line, or in any regiments excepting
those which are exclusively their own; but by means of this regulation
they escape the persecutions under which the other casts
suffer during the time of recruiting. The officers and men of the
Henrique regiments are so united to each other, that the privates
and subalterns are less liable to be oppressed by any white man in
office even than the soldiers of the mulatto regiments. Of these
latter the officers, having a considerable tinge of white, sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
lean towards the wishes of the <i>capitam-mor</i>, or some other rich
white officer, instead of protecting his soldiers.</p>

<p>The men whose occupation it is to apprehend runaway negroes are,
almost without exception, creole blacks; they are called <i>capitaens-do-campo</i>,
captains of the field; and are subject to a <i>capitam-mor do
campo</i> who resides in Recife, and they receive their commissions
either from the governor or from this officer. By these they are
authorised to apprehend and take to their owners any slaves who
may be found absent from their homes without their master’s consent.
Several of these men are to be found in every district, employing themselves
in such pursuits as they think fit, when their services are not
required in that calling which forms their particular duty. They are
men of undaunted courage, and are usually followed by two or three
dogs, which are trained to seek out, and if necessary to attack and
bring to the ground those persons whose apprehension their masters
are desirous of effecting. The men who bear these commissions can
oblige any unauthorised person to give up to them an apprehended
negro, for the purpose of being by them returned to his owner.</p>

<p>It is scarcely necessary to name the mestizos, for they usually
class with the mulattos; nor are they to be easily distinguished from
some of the darker varieties of this cast. A dark coloured man of a
disagreeable countenance and badly formed person is commonly
called a mestizo, without any reference to his origin.</p>

<p>Yet one race of human beings remain to be spoken of; but the individuals
who compose it are not sufficiently numerous to permit
them to take their place among the several great divisions of the human
family which form the population of Brazil, and therefore I did
not rank this among the others which are of more importance. Still
the <i>çiganos</i><a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a>, for thus they are called, must not be forgotten. I frequently
heard of these people, but never had an opportunity of seeing
any of them. Parties of <i>çiganos</i> were in the habit of appearing formerly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
once every year at the village of Pasmado, and other places
in that part of the country; but the late governor of the province was
inimical to them, and some attempts having been made to apprehend
some of them, their visits were discontinued. They are represented
as being a people of a brownish cast, with features which
resemble those of white persons, and as being tall and handsome.
They wander from place to place in parties of men, women, and
children; exchanging, buying, and selling horses, and gold and silver
trinkets. The women travel on horseback, sitting between the panniers
of the loaded horses, and the young ones are placed within
the panniers among the baggage. The men are excellent horsemen,
and although the pack-horses may be overburthened, these fellows
will only accommodate matters by riding slowly upon their
own horses, and never think of dividing the loads more equally;
but they preserve themselves and the animals upon which they ride
quite unencumbered. They are said to be unmindful of all religious
observances; and never to hear Mass or confess their sins.
It is likewise said that they never marry out of their own nation.</p>

<p>There are now several British merchants established at Recife, and
a consul likewise resides at that place; but at the time of my coming
away, there was no protestant chapel, no clergyman, nor even a
burial ground for our countrymen. An Act of Parliament has, I
believe, provided for the establishment of these things, but no steps
have been taken towards the accomplishment of the directions of the
legislature. Without any outward appearance of religion, how are
we to expect that the people of Brazil are to regard us as any thing
better than what we were represented to them as being in former
times?&mdash;as pagans, animals, and horses&mdash;<i>pagoens</i>, <i>bichos</i>, and
<i>cavallos</i>, this is literally true; and although they are now aware that at
any rate we have the forms of human beings, that we have the power
of speech, and that we have our share of intellect in all the common
transactions of the world, still how are we to look for respect from
them towards a set of men, who have no appearance at least, of possessing
any religious feelings? It should be recollected that we are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
living among a people who are deeply rivetted to their own forms
and ceremonies of worship, whose devotedness to their church establishment
surpasses every other feeling. It is not thus that the British
nation is to become respectable; we may have relations of trade
with these people, but we must be content to be merely regarded
according to our utility; there can be no respect for our general
character as a body of men, none of that regard which would make
us listened to in any great question, which would make our opinions
and our assertions depended upon as coming from men of steadiness,&mdash;of
religious habits. Nor can we be accounted as more than residents
for a time, we cannot be considered as an established community,
who are thus without any common bond of union, who have
not any general place of meeting, who have not any one point to
which all are directed; we have no appearance of belonging to one
nation, as if we were brethren meeting in a foreign land. To these
political reasons for the establishment of a place of worship are to
be added those which are of far greater importance, those to which
no Christian ought to be indifferent. I well know that it is not with
the merchants that the evil arises;&mdash;but enough, I will go no farther,
although I could tarry long upon this subject. I wish however that I
could have avoided the mention of it altogether. I might have done
so, if I had not felt that I was passing by unnoticed a subject upon
which I have often spoken whilst I was upon the spot; and there my
sentiments are well known to most of those persons with whom I
associated.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XIX.</h2>

<p class="pch">SLAVERY.</p>

<p class="drop-cap03">THE general equity of the laws regarding free persons of colour
in the Portugueze South American possessions, has been to a
certain degree extended to that portion of the population which is in
a state of slavery; and the lives of the slaves of Brazil have been
rendered less hard and less intolerable than those of the degraded
beings who drag on their cheerless existence under the dominion
of other nations. The Brazilian slave is taught the religion of his
master, and hopes are held out of manumission from his own exertions;
but still he is a slave, and must be guided by another man’s
will; and this feeling alone takes away much of the pleasure which
would be felt from the faithful discharge of his duty, if it was
voluntarily performed. The consciousness that if the directions
were not willingly attended to, the arbitrary will of the master would
enforce their performance, removes much of the desire to please;
obedience to a command is not required with any idea that refusal
can possibly ensue, and therefore no merit is attached to its accomplishment
by him whose orders are obeyed; nor does the slave feel
that he is doing in any degree more than would be enforced if he had
made any doubts. The world has heard so much, and from so
many quarters, of the enormities which have been committed by
slave-owners in the colonies with which England has had any communication;
both from her own possessions, and from those of other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
nations, that no doubts can be entertained of their existence. That
such evil deeds are of frequent occurrence, I would not wish to suppose,
though that they are dreadfully too frequent is well known; I
had rather not be persuaded that man in so depraved a state is often
to be met with;&mdash;that many civilized beings should have made such
rapid returns to barbarism. I have to say, that in Brazil too, such
instances of barbarity are spoken of&mdash;that they do exist; they are,
however, of rare occurrence, they are seldom heard of, and are
always mentioned with abhorrence; but it is enough that instances
should be recorded, of the abuse of this absolute power of one man
over another; it is enough that this absolute power itself should be
allowed to continue, to render the system upon which it is founded
an evil of such great importance, as to sanction all exertions for its
removal, as to make any government overlook many inconveniences
rather than increase the numbers of those human beings who suffer
this dreadful degradation.</p>

<p>The Indian slavery has been for many years abolished in Brazil,
and the individuals who are now in bondage in that country are
Africans, and their descendants on both sides, or individuals whose
mothers are of African origin; and no line is drawn at which the
near approach to the colour and blood of the whites entitles the child,
whose mother is a slave, to freedom. I have seen several persons
who were to all appearance of white origin, still doomed to slavery.</p>

<p>Slaves, however, in Brazil, have many advantages over their brethren
in the British colonies. The numerous holidays of which the
Catholic religion enjoins the observance<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a>, give to the slave many
days of rest or time to work for his own profit; thirty-five of these,
and the Sundays besides, allow him to employ much of his time as
he pleases. Few masters are inclined to restrain the right of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
slaves to dispose of these days as they think fit, or at any rate few
dare, whatever their inclinations may be, to brave public opinion in
depriving them of the intervals from work which the law has set
apart as their own, that their lives may be rendered less irksome.
The time which is thus afforded enables the slave, who is so inclined,
to accumulate a sum of money; however this is by law his master’s
property, from the incapability under which a slave labours of possessing
any thing which he can by right call his own. But I believe
there is no instance on record in which a master attempted to deprive
his slave of these hard-earned gains. The slave can oblige his
master to manumit him, on tendering to him the sum for which he
was first purchased, or the price for which he might be sold, if that
price is higher than what the slave was worth at the time he was first
bought<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a>. This regulation, like every one that is framed in favour
of slaves, is liable to be evaded, and the master sometimes does
refuse to manumit a valuable slave; and no appeal is made by the
sufferer, owing to the state of law in that country, which renders it
almost impossible for the slave to gain a hearing; and likewise this
acquiescence in the injustice of the master proceeds from the dread,
that if he was not to succeed he would be punished, and that his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
life might be rendered more miserable than it was before<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a>. Consequently
a great deal depends upon the inclinations of the master,
who will however be very careful in refusing to manumit, owing to
the well-known opinion of every priest in favour of this regulation,
to the feelings of the individuals of his own class in society, and to
those of the lower orders of people, and likewise he will be afraid
of losing his slave; he may escape with his money, and the master
will then run much risk of never seeing him again, particularly if
the individual is a creole slave<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a>. In general therefore no doubts
are urged, when application is made for manumission by a slave to
his master; who is indeed oftentimes prepared for it by the habits<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
of industry and regularity of his slave, and by common report among
the other slaves and free persons upon the estate, that the individual
in question is scraping together a sum of money for this purpose.
The master might indeed deprive the slave of the fruits of his own
labour, but this is never thought of, because the slave preserves his
money in a secret place, or has entrusted it to some person upon
whom he can depend, and would suffer any punishment rather than disclose
the spot in which his wealth lies concealed. A still more forcible
reason than any other, for the forbearance of the master, is to be
found in the dread of acting against public opinion; in the shame
which would follow the commission of such an act; and perhaps the
natural goodness which exists in almost every human being, would
make him shun such gross injustice, would make him avoid such a
deed of baseness.</p>

<p>A slave is often permitted by his owner to seek a master more to
his liking; for this purpose a note is given, declaring that the bearer
has leave to enter into the service of any one, upon the price which
the master demands being paid by the purchaser. With this the
slave applies to any individual of property whom he may wish to
serve; owing to having heard a good report of his character towards
his slaves, or from any other cause. This is a frequent practice, and
at least admits the possibility of escape from a severe state of bondage
to one that is less irksome.</p>

<p>A considerable number of slaves are manumitted at the death of
their masters, and indeed some persons of large property fail not to
set at liberty a few of them during their own life-time. A deed of
manumission, however simply it may be drawn out, cannot be set
aside; a register of these papers is preserved at the office of every
notary-public, by which any distress which might be occasioned by
the loss of the originals is provided against, for the copy of course
holds good in law. A slave who has brought into the world, and has
reared ten children, ought to be free, for so the law ordains; but this
regulation is generally evaded; and besides, the number of children<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span>
is too great for many women to be enabled to be benefited by it<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a>.
The price of a new-born child is 5<i>l.</i> (20,000 <i>mil-reis</i>,) and the master
is obliged to manumit the infant at the baptismal font, on the
sum being presented. In this manner a considerable number of
persons are set at liberty, for the smallness of the price enables many
freemen who have had connections with female slaves to manumit
their offspring; and instances occur of the sponsors performing this
most laudable act. Not unfrequently female slaves apply to persons
of consideration to become sponsors to their children, in the hopes
that the pride of these will be too great to allow of their god-child
remaining in slavery<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a>. Thus by their own exertions, by the favour
of their masters, and by other means, the individuals who gain their
freedom annually are very numerous.</p>

<p>The comforts of slaves in different situations are widely disproportionate;
whilst some are doomed to an existence of excessive
toil and misery, from the nature of their occupations and the characters
of their masters, others lead a comparatively easy life. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>
is true, that in countries of which the workmen are free, the daily
labour is unequally divided, but their wages are proportioned accordingly,
and as each man is a free agent he seeks that employment
to which his bodily and mental powers are befitted. The slave is
purchased for a certain purpose, and is to follow the line of life which
his master has chalked out for him; he is not to be occupied in that
which he would himself prefer, or at any rate his wishes are not consulted
upon the subject. The price for which a slave is to be obtained,
and the convenience of the purchaser are oftener consulted than
the fitness of his bodily strength to the labour which it is his lot to be
ordered to perform. Besides the obligation of following an unsuitable
trade, or at any rate of following one which he has not chosen,
he has to endure the still incomparably greater grievance of bearing
with a tyrannical, an inconsiderate, or a peevish master, whose
commands are not to be called in question, whose will is absolute,
and from whom the possibility of appeal is far removed, and that of
redress placed at a still greater distance. Masters are punished by
the payment of fines, for cruelty to their slaves, if any account of
such behaviour should reach the ear of the <i>Ouvidor</i> of the province;
but I never heard of punishment having been carried farther than this
trifling manner of correction. The emoluments which proceed from
this mode of chastising the offenders weigh heavily in its favour; the
injury which the slave has received is not, I am afraid, the only cause
which urges the exaction of the stipulated penalty; of this the slave
does not receive any part.</p>

<p>All slaves in Brazil follow the religion of their masters<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a>; and notwithstanding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>
the impure state in which the Christian church exists
in that country, still such are the beneficent effects of the Christian
religion, that these, its adopted children, are improved by it to an
infinite degree; and the slave who attends to the strict observance
of religious ceremonies invariably proves to be a good servant.
The Africans who are imported from Angola are baptized in lots
before they leave their own shores, and on their arrival in Brazil
they are to learn the doctrines of the church, and the duties of the
religion into which they have entered. These bear the mark of the
royal crown upon their breasts, which denotes that they have undergone
the ceremony of baptism, and likewise that the king’s duty
has been paid upon them<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a>. The slaves which are imported from
other parts of the coast of Africa, arrive in Brazil unbaptized, and
before the ceremony of making them Christians can be performed
upon them, they must be taught certain prayers, for the acquirement
of which one year is allowed to the master, before he is obliged to
present the slave at the parish church. This law is not always
strictly adhered to as to time, but it is never evaded altogether.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
The religion of the master teaches him that it would be extremely
sinful to allow his slave to remain a heathen; and indeed the Portugueze
and Brazilians have too much religious feeling to let them
neglect any of the ordinances of their church. The slave himself
likewise wishes to be made a Christian, for his fellow-bondmen will
in every squabble or trifling disagreement with him, close their string
of opprobrious epithets with the name of <i>pagam</i> (pagan.) The unbaptized
negro feels that he is considered as an inferior being, and
although he may not be aware of the value which the whites place
upon baptism, still he knows that the stigma for which he is upbraided
will be removed by it; and therefore he is desirous of being
made equal to his companions. The Africans who have been long
imported, imbibe a Catholic feeling, and appear to forget that they
were once in the same situation themselves. The slaves are not
asked whether they will be baptized or not; their entrance into the
Catholic church is treated as a thing of course; and indeed they are
not considered as members of society, but rather as brute animals,
until they can lawfully go to mass, confess their sins, and receive
the sacrament.</p>

<p>The slaves have their religious brotherhoods as well as the free
persons; and the ambition of a slave very generally aims at being
admitted into one of these, and at being made one of the officers
and directors of the concerns of the brotherhood; even some of the
money which the industrious slave is collecting for the purpose of
purchasing his freedom will oftentimes be brought out of its concealment
for the decoration of a saint, that the donor may become
of importance in the society to which he belongs. The negroes
have one invocation of the Virgin, (or I might almost say one virgin)
which is peculiarly their own. Our Lady of the Rosary is even
sometimes painted with a black face and hands. It is in this manner
that the slaves are led to place their attention upon an object
in which they soon take an interest, but from which no injury can
proceed towards themselves, nor can any through its means be by them
inflicted upon their masters. Their ideas are removed from any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
thought of the customs of their own country, and are guided
into a channel of a totally different nature, and completely unconnected
with what is practised there. The election of a King of
Congo (which I have mentioned in chapter 13,) by the individuals
who come from that part of Africa, seems indeed as if it would give
them a bias towards the customs of their native soil; but the Brazilian
Kings of Congo worship Our Lady of the Rosary, and are
dressed in the dress of white men; they and their subjects dance,
it is true, after the manner of their country; but to these festivals
are admitted African negroes of other nations, creole blacks, and
mulattos, all of whom dance after the same manner; and these
dances are now as much the national dances of Brazil as they are of
Africa. The Portugueze language is spoken by all the slaves, and
their own dialects are allowed to lay dormant until they are by many
of them quite forgotten. No compulsion is resorted to to make
them embrace the habits of their masters, but their ideas are insensibly
led to imitate and adopt them. The masters at the same time
imbibe some of the customs of their slaves, and thus the superior
and his dependant are brought nearer to each other. I doubt not
that the system of baptizing the newly-imported negroes, proceeded
rather from the bigotry of the Portugueze in former times than from
any political plan; but it has had the most beneficial effects. The
slaves are rendered more tractable; besides being better men and
women, they become more obedient servants; they are brought
under the controul of the priesthood, and even if this was the only
additional hold which was gained by their entrance into the church,
it is a great engine of power which is thus brought into action.</p>

<p>But in no circumstance has the introduction of the Christian religion
among the slaves been of more service than in the change which
it has wrought in the men regarding the treatment of their women,
and in the conduct of the females themselves. A writer of great
reputation on West-Indian affairs, states that the introduction of
the marriage ceremony among the slaves of the colonies of which he
treats “would be utterly impracticable to any good purpose;” and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>
again, that he who conceives that a remedy may be found for polygamy
“by introducing among them the laws of marriage, as established
in Europe, is utterly ignorant of their manners, propensities,
and superstitions<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a>.” Is it not that by the masters these things
are considered to be of little importance, and therefore unworthy of
much trouble? As long as the work is done, little else is thought of.
Where the <i>interest</i> of the master is concerned, the “manners, propensities,
and superstitions” will soon be overcome. I hope that at the
present day such opinions do not generally exist. All men in the same
state of barbarism treat their women in the same manner; the evil
lies not with the race of beings, but in the dreadful situation to which
this one is reduced. Why, therefore, not attempt to improve and to
benefit the individuals of which it is composed?</p>

<p>The slaves of Brazil are regularly married according to the forms
of the Catholic church; the banns are published in the same manner
as those of free persons; and I have seen many happy couples (as
happy at least as slaves can be) with large families of children rising
around them. The masters encourage marriages among their slaves,
for it is from these lawful connections that they can expect to increase
the number of their creoles. A slave cannot marry
without the consent of his master, for the vicar will not publish the
banns of marriage without this sanction. It is likewise permitted
that slaves should marry free persons; if the woman is in bondage,
the children remain in the same state, but if the man is a slave, and
she is free, their offspring is also free. A slave cannot be married
until the requisite prayers have been learnt, the nature of confession
be understood, and the Sacrament can be received. Upon the estates
the master or manager is soon made acquainted with the predilections
of the slaves for each other, and these being discovered, marriage
is forthwith determined upon, and the irregular proceedings are
made lawful. In towns there is more licentiousness among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span>
the negroes, as there is among all other classes of men<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a>. The passion
of love is supposed only to exist in a certain state of civilization,
and this may be granted without at the same time declaring that
negroes are incapable of lasting attachment, without supposing that
the regard of each sex is mere animal desire, unconnected with predilection.
That species of affection which is heightened until personal
possession is almost forgotten, doubtless is not felt by human
beings who are in a state of barbarism; but still a negro may be
attached, he may fix upon one object in preference to all others.
That this is the case, I can vouch; I have known and have heard of
many instances in which punishments and other dangers have been
braved to visit a chosen one; in which journies by night have been
made after a day of fatigue; in which great constancy has been
shewn, and a determination that the feelings of the heart shall not
be controuled.<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a></p>

<p>The great proportion of men upon many of the estates, produces,
of necessity, most mischievous consequences. A supply is requisite
to keep up the number of labourers. The women are more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>
liable to misconduct<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a>, and the men imbibe unsettled habits; but if
an adequate number of females are placed upon the estate, and the
slaves are trained and taught in the manner which is practised upon
well-regulated plantations, the negroes will be as correct in their
behaviour, as any other body of men; and perhaps their conduct
may be less faulty than that of other descriptions of persons, who
have less to occupy their time, though their education may be infinitely
superior. That many men and many women will be licentious,
has been and is still the lot of human nature, and not the peculiar
fault of the much injured race of which I speak.</p>

<p>I shall now state the manner in which the Africans are transported
from their own country to Brazil, and the disposal of them on
their arrival in South America; the characters of the several African
nations with which the ships are loaded; the condition of those who
are employed in Recife,&mdash;upon the sugar plantations,&mdash;in the Mata
or cotton estates,&mdash;and in the Sertam or cattle districts.</p>

<p>As the voyage from the coast of Africa to the opposite shores of
South America is usually short, for the winds are subject to little variation
and the weather is fine, the vessels which are employed in this
traffic are generally speaking small, and are not of the best construction.
The situation of captain or master of a slave ship is considered
of secondary rank in the Portugueze merchant-service, and
the persons who are usually so occupied are vastly inferior to the
generality of the individuals who command the large and regular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span>
trading vessels between Europe and Brazil. The slave ships<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> were
formerly crowded to a most shocking degree, nor was there any
means of preventing this; but a law has been passed for the purpose
of restricting the number of persons for each vessel. However,
I more than suspect, that no attention is paid to this
regulation,&mdash;that means are made use of to evade the law. On
the arrival at Recife of a cargo of slaves, the rules of the port direct
that these persons shall be disembarked and taken to St. Amaro,
which is an airy spot, and sufficiently distant from the town to
prevent the admittance of any infectious disorder, if any such should
exist among the newly-imported negroes; and yet the place is at
a convenient distance for the purchasers, St. Amaro being situated
immediately opposite to Recife, upon the inland bank of the expanse
of waters which is formed by the tide on the land side of the town.
However, like many others, this excellent arrangement is not
attended to, and even if the slaves are removed for a few days to
St. Amaro, they are soon conveyed back to the town. Here they
are placed in the streets before the doors of their owners, regardless
of decency, of humanity, and of due attention to the general health
of the town. The small pox, the yaws, and other complaints have
thus frequent opportunities of spreading. It is probable, that if the
climate was not so very excellent as it is, this practice would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span>
discontinued, but if it was not put a stop to, and the country was
subject to pestilential complaints, the town would not be habitable.</p>

<p>In the day-time some of the streets of Recife are in part lined
with these miserable beings, who are lying or sitting promiscuously
upon the foot-path, sometimes to the number of two or three hundred.
The males wear a small piece of blue cloth round their waists,
which is drawn between the legs and fastened behind; the females
are allowed a larger piece of cloth, which is worn as a petticoat; and
sometimes a second portion is given to them, for the purpose of
covering the upper parts of the body. The stench which is created
by these assemblages is almost intolerable to one who is unaccustomed
to their vicinity; and the sight of them, good God, is horrid
beyond any thing. These people do not however seem to feel their
situation, any farther than that it is uncomfortable. Their food consists
of salt meat, the flour of the mandioc, beans, and plantains occasionally;
the victuals for each day are cooked in the middle of the
street in an enormous caldron. At night they are driven into one or
more warehouses, and a driver stands to count them as they pass;
they are locked in, and the door is again opened at day-break on the
following morning. The wish of these wretched creatures to escape
from this state of inaction and discomfort is manifested upon the
appearance of a purchaser; they start up willingly, to be placed in the
row for the purpose of being viewed and handled like cattle, and on
being chosen they give signs of much pleasure. I have had many
opportunities of seeing slaves bought, for my particular friends at
Recife lived opposite to slave-dealers. I never saw any demonstrations
of grief at parting from each other; but I attribute this to the
dread of punishment if there had been any flow of feeling, and to a
resigned or rather despairing sensation which checks any shew of
grief, and which has prepared them for the worst, by making them
indifferent to whatever may occur; besides, it is not often that a
family is brought over together,&mdash;the separation of relatives and friends
has taken place in Africa. It is among the younger part of the
assemblage of persons who are exposed for sale that pleasure is particularly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span>
visible at the change of situation, in being removed from
the streets of the town; the negroes of more advanced age do
whatever the driver desires, usually with an unchanged countenance.
I am afraid that very little care is taken to prevent the separation
of relations who may chance to come over in the same ship; and any
consideration on this point lies entirely with the owner of the cargo<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a>.
A species of relationship exists between the individuals who have
been imported in the same ship; they call each other <i>malungos</i>, and
this term is much regarded among them. The purchaser gives to
each of his newly-bought slaves a large piece of baize and a straw
hat, and as soon as possible marches them off to his estate. I have
often in travelling met with many parties going up to their new
homes, and have observed that they were usually cheerful;&mdash;any
thing is better than to sit at the door of the slave merchant in Recife.
The new master too does every thing in his power to keep them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span>
in good humour at first, whatever his conduct may afterwards be towards
them.</p>

<p>The slaves which are usually brought to Pernambuco are known
under the names of Angola, Congo, Rebolo, Anjico, Gabam, and
Mosambique. These last have only been imported of late years, owing,
I rather imagine, to the difficulty with which slaves have been
obtained on the western coast of Africa, caused by the vigilance of
the British cruisers in that quarter, and the vexations to which some
of the slave ships have been liable from detention, although they
were ultimately suffered to proceed on their voyages.</p>

<p>The Angola negroes make the best slaves; many of them have
been in bondage in their own country, and therefore to these the
change is for the better. Some of them have even served the whites
in the city of Loanda, which is the principal Portugueze settlement
upon the coast of Africa. But others were free in Angola, and consequently
to these is allotted a life of disappointment and vexation,
whenever they remember their own country. The negroes from
Angola are however usually tractable, and may be taught to perform
the menial services of a house or stable without much pains being
taken with them; and they often shew great attachment<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a>, fidelity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span>
and honesty. The Angola negroes are those who most commonly
exert themselves to purchase their own freedom. The Congo negroes
partake much of the character of the Angolans, being equally
tractable; but they are steadier, and are particularly adapted to the
regular routine of field labour. They are less quick in their movements
than the Angolans, and do not seem to be so spirited and
courageous; they obtain in a short period a knowledge of the
Portugueze language. The Rebolos can scarcely in person be distinguished
from the two former, being stoutly made, and not tall;
they have a black skin, but it is not shining, and the features are
flat. They seem to be a branch of the Angolans and Congos, but
they are more obstinate, and more subject to despond than the others.
These three tribes appear to have belonged originally to the same
nation, for many parts of their characters are similar, their persons
are of the same mould, and the dialects of each sufficiently resemble
each other to be understood by all the three.</p>

<p>The Anjico negroes shew many marks of being of another nation;
they make good slaves if they are well treated, and are yet preserved
under due controul. They are difficult to train, and bear a heavy
yoke impatiently; there is in them much independence of character,
if they dared to shew it; there is also much cunning, and the
desire and capability of over-reaching. Their persons are tall and
well formed, their skins are of a glossy black, their eyes are expressive,
and their countenances plainly denote that it is not by their
own will that they continue in slavery. They are not however numerous.
Great neatness is shown by them in their household
arrangements, and they often exert themselves to obtain money;
but they are less careful and prudent than the nations of which
I have already treated. All the Anjico negroes have three gashes
on each cheek, which are cut in a circular form from the ear to the
mouth.<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span></p>

<p>The <i>Gabam</i> or Gaboon negroes have not been very long introduced,
and from the well known general character of the nation they
are sold at a reduced price. I have heard many persons state that
they are cannibals<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a>. They appear to be in a still more savage state
than any of the former-mentioned nations, and are much given to
despondency and consequent suicide; indeed ten and even twenty
that have been purchased together have, in some instances, in the
course of a short period, all died from despair, or have put an end
to their lives in a more summary manner. It is with difficulty that
the Gaboons can be taught to perform any labour above that of the
simplest description; and sometimes they remain for years unbaptized,
from the great trouble which is required in making them articulate
any sounds to which they have not been accustomed. Yet it
is rather that they <i>will</i> not be taught, than that they <i>cannot</i> learn,
for I have heard many planters say, that if a <i>Gabam</i> negro can be
made cheerful, and is induced to take an interest in those persons
who are around him and in his occupations, he becomes a most useful
and intelligent slave. The <i>Gabam</i> negroes are tall and handsome,
and their skins are very black and shining; the features of many of
them are good, being much less flat and blunt than those of their
countrymen in general.</p>

<p>The Mosambique negroes are a poor and ugly race of beings, languid
and inactive, and subject to despondency. Their colour inclines
to brown, but still they have completely the negro features. As
the price of these slaves is much below that of any other description
of negroes, some of the planters have taken them on trial, but
they are said to have many of the bad qualities of the <i>Gaboons</i> without
their hardiness.</p>

<p>A negro will sometimes tell his master that he is determined to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span>
die, and too often the effects of his resolve begin shortly afterwards
to be perceived; he becomes thin, loses his appetite, and dies almost
a skeleton. One of the means which it is very generally said that
these miserable beings employ for the purpose of destroying themselves,
is that of eating considerable quantities of lime and earth,
which either produces emaciation or dropsy. But it is strange that a
habit of eating lime and earth should be contracted in some instances
by African and likewise by creole children, and as frequently by free
children as by those who are in slavery. This practice is not treated
as if it were a disorder, but it is accounted a habit, which, by attention
from those who have the charge of the children&mdash;in watching and
punishing them, may be conquered without the aid of medicine. I
know of some instances in which no medical treatment was deemed
necessary, but the individuals recovered by means of chastisement
and constant vigilance. It is a subject upon which I was often led
to converse, and I discovered that most of the free-born families were
acquainted with the practice from experience among their own children
or those of their neighbours, and that they always considered
it as a habit and not as a disease. Among adults, however, slaves are
infinitely more subject to it than free persons.<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a></p>

<p>Pernambuco has never experienced any serious revolt among the
slaves; but at Bahia there have been several commotions<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a>. I believe
that Bahia contains fewer free people than Pernambuco in proportion
to the number of slaves; but I cannot avoid attributing the
quietude of the latter in some measure to the circumstance of few of
the Gold Coast negroes being imported to it, whilst at Bahia the
principal stock of slaves is from that part of Africa. It is by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span>
<i>Mina</i> negroes in Bahia that the revolts have been made, and by the
<i>Koromanties</i> in Jamaica, in 1760<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a>. These are, I believe, the same
people under different names, and they are represented as possessing
great firmness of mind and body, and ferociousness of disposition.</p>

<p>The <i>Obeah</i>-men of the Columbian islands and the <i>Mandingueiros</i>
of Brazil<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a>, are evidently, from their practices, the same description
of persons. The religion which the Brazilian slaves are taught, has
likewise a salutary effect upon this point, for it tends to lessen or
entirely removes the faith which was previously entertained by the
Africans respecting the incantations of their countrymen; the superstitions
of their native land are replaced by others of a more harmless
nature. The dreadful effects of faith in the <i>Obeah</i>-men which
sometimes occur in the British colonies, are not experienced in
Brazil from the <i>Mandingueiros</i>: belief in their powers is certainly
not extinguished, and indeed even some of the creoles imbibe a
notion of the efficacy of their spells, but the effects of these are not
generally felt.</p>

<p>The slaves who are employed in Recife may be divided into two
classes; household slaves, and those which pay a weekly stipend to
their owners proceeding from the earnings of some employment
which does not oblige them to be under the immediate eye of the
master. The first class have little chance of gaining their freedom
by their own exertions, and are subject to the caprice and whims of
their superiors; but some few are manumitted by the kindness of those
whom they have served, and the clothing and food which is afforded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span>
to them is generally better than that which the other class obtains.
This second class consists of joiners, shoemakers, &amp;c. canoe-men,
porters, &amp;c. and these men may acquire a sufficient sum of money to
purchase their own freedom, if they have the requisite prudence and
steadiness to allow their earnings to accumulate; but too often, the
inducements to expend them foolishly are sufficiently powerful to
make these people swerve from their purpose. They generally earn
more each day than the master exacts, and have besides the Sundays
and holidays as their own; and if the slave feeds and cloaths
himself, to these are added the Saturday of every week<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a>. I think
that allowing largely for him to supply every thing requisite for his
support and decent appearance, and yet something for what to a person
in such a rank in life may be accounted luxury, a slave so circumstanced
may in ten years purchase his freedom. If his value is
great, it is because his trade is lucrative, so that these things keep
pace with each other. The women have likewise some employments
by which they may be enabled to gain their liberty; they make
sweetmeats and cakes, and are sent out as cooks, nurses, housekeepers,
&amp;c.</p>

<p>Creole negroes and mulattos are generally accounted quicker in
learning any trade than the Africans. This superior aptitude to
profit by instruction is doubtless produced by their acquaintance from
infancy with the manners, customs, and language of their masters.
From the little experience, however, which I have had, and from
the general remarks which I have gathered from others, who might
be judged better acquainted than myself with slaves, I think that an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span>
African who has become chearful, and seems to have forgotten his
former state, is a more valuable slave than a creole negro or mulatto.
He will be generally more fit to be trusted. Far from the
latter submitting quietly to the situation in which they have been
born, they bear the yoke of slavery with impatience; the daily sight
of so many individuals of their own casts, who are in a state of
freedom, makes them wish to be raised to an equality with them,
and they feel at every moment their unfortunate doom. The consideration
with which the free persons of mixed casts are treated,
tends to increase the discontent of their brothers who are in slavery.
The Africans do not feel this, for they are considered by their creole
brethren in colour, as being so completely inferior, that the line
which by public opinion has been drawn between them, makes the
imported slave feel towards the creoles as if they had not been originally
of the same stock.</p>

<p>Miserable objects are at times to be seen in Recife, asking alms
in various quarters of the town, aged and diseased; some of these
persons have been slaves, and when, from infirmity they have been
rendered useless, their masters have manumitted them; and thus
being turned away to starve in their old age, or in a crippled state,
their only resource is to beg in the public streets. These instances
of gross injustice and depravity in masters, are not many, but
that they should occur, is sufficient to cause the aid of law to be
called in, that the <i>existence</i> of them should be prevented.</p>

<p>The sugar-plantations which belong to the Benedictine monks and
Carmelite friars, are those upon which the labour is conducted with
the greatest attention to system, and with the greatest regard to the
comfort and ease of the slaves. I can more particularly speak
of the estates of the Benedictine monks, because my residence at
Jaguaribe gave me daily opportunities of hearing of the management
of one of their establishments; and although sugar-works were
not erected upon the estate in question, still the number of negroes
which were upon it, was fully adequate to this purpose. Besides, in
some years canes were planted upon it, which were to be ground at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span>
some neighbouring mill. The frequent communication, likewise,
which there was between the slaves of this plantation and those of
the other estates, belonging to the same convent, upon which sugar is
made, enabled me to ascertain that all the establishments which are
owned by the Benedictines, are conducted in the same manner.</p>

<p>The slaves of the Jaguaribe St. Bento estate are all creoles, and are
in number about one hundred. The children are carefully taught
their prayers by some of the elder negroes, and the hymn to the
Virgin is sung by all the slaves, male and female, who can possibly
attend, at seven o’clock every evening; at this hour it is required
that every person shall be at home. The young children are allowed
to amuse themselves as they please during the greatest part of the
day; and their only occupation for certain hours is to pick cotton for
lamps, and to separate the beans which are fit for seed from those
which are rotten, and other work of the same description. When they
arrive at the age of ten and twelve years, the girls spin thread for
making the coarse cotton cloth of the country, and the boys attend to
the horses and oxen, driving them to pasture, &amp;c. If a child
evinces peculiar fitness for any trade, care is taken that his talents
should be applied in the manner which he would himself prefer. A
few of them are taught music, and assist in the church festivals of
the convent. Marriages are encouraged; as early as the age of seventeen
and eighteen years for the men, and at fourteen and fifteen for
the girls, many of these unions take place. Immediately after their
entrance into this state, the people begin to labour regularly in
the field for their owners; oftentimes both boys and girls request the
manager to allow them to commence their life of daily toil, before
the age which is pointed out by the regulations of the convent; and
this occurs because they are not permitted to possess provision
grounds of their own until they labour for their masters. Almost
every description of labour is done by piece-work; and the task is
usually accomplished by three o’clock in the afternoon, which gives
to those who are industrious an opportunity of working daily upon
their own grounds. The slaves are allowed the Saturday of every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span>
week to provide for their own subsistence, besides the Sundays and
holidays. Those who are diligent fail not to obtain their freedom
by purchase. The provision grounds are never interfered with by
the monks, and when a negro dies or obtains his freedom, he is permitted
to bequeath his plot of land to any of his companions whom
he may please to favour in this manner. The superannuated slaves
are carefully provided with food and cloathing.<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a></p>

<p>None of the monks reside upon the Jaguaribe estate, but
one of them comes from Olinda almost every Sunday and holiday
to say Mass. Upon the other Benedictine estates there are
resident monks. The slaves treat their masters with great familiarity;
they only pay respect to the abbot, whom they regard as the representative
of the Saint. The conduct of the younger members of the
communities of regular clergy, is well known not to be by any means
correct; the vows of celibacy are not strictly adhered to. This circumstance
decreases the respect with which these men might otherwise
be treated upon their own estates, and increases much the licentiousness
of the women. I have seen upon these plantations many light-coloured
mulatto slaves; but when the approximation to white
blood becomes considerable, a marriage is projected for the individual
with a person of a darker tint. No compulsion is made use
of to oblige any one to marry, and therefore many of the slaves,
contrary to the wishes of their masters, remain single. The monks
allow their female slaves to marry free men, but the male slaves are
not permitted to marry free women. Many reasons are alleged in
favour of this regulation. One is that they do not wish that a slave
should be useless in the way of increasing the stock of the plantation;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span>
likewise the monks do not wish to have a free family residing
among their slaves (for obvious reasons), which must be the
case if a man marries a free woman; they have less objection to a man,
because he is during the whole of the day away from their people, or
is perhaps employed by the community, and thus in part dependant
upon it, and he merely comes to sleep in one of the huts;
besides, a stranger is contributing to the increase of the stock.</p>

<p>The Jaguaribe estate is managed by a mulatto slave, who married
a person of his own colour, and she likewise belonged to the
convent. Her husband has purchased her freedom and that of her
children; he possesses two African slaves, the profits of whose labour
are entirely his own; but he is himself obliged to attend to the
business of the plantation, and to see that the work of his masters is
properly executed. This man has offered his two Africans in exchange
for himself to the monks; but they tell him that the Jaguaribe
estate could not be properly managed without his assistance; and,
though much against his inclination, he continues in slavery. This
is one of the strongest instances of man’s desire to act for himself;
Nicolau enjoys the entire direction of the estate, and every comfort
which a man of his description can possibly wish for; when he moves
from home, he is as well mounted as the generality of the rich
planters; he is permitted to be seated in the presence of his masters,
and indeed is allowed all the privileges of free men; and yet the
consciousness of being under the controul of another always occupies
his mind, and leads him to desire the possession of those privileges
as a right, which he at present only enjoys by sufferance.<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span></p>

<p>Slavery, however, in this less intolerable state exists in only a few
instances; and although a great many of the planters certainly do
treat their slaves with considerable regard and attention to their
comforts, still, upon <i>none</i> of the estates, <i>excepting</i> those of the
religious communities which have been mentioned, is the complete
system of rendering unnecessary a constant supply of new labourers,
made the primary object;&mdash;the end to which all other considerations
must give place.</p>

<p>Next to the plantations which belong to the convents, stand
some of those of the rich Brazilian owners, who go on quietly, if
not systematically. Here the labour is not in general done
by piece-work, nor do the labourers provide for their own subsistence;
and the slaves are sent to the field at an earlier age than
they ought, and earlier than is practised upon the convent estates.
Some of the plantations, however, which are owned by individuals, do
give the Saturday of each week for the slave to support himself<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a>.
Corporal punishments are resorted to contrary to the custom of the
St. Bento and Carmo estates, and though great cruelties are not
<i>often</i> committed<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a>, still the mode of punishment produces much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span>
suffering, much misery, much degradation. Confinement and privations,
would, I rather imagine, be more efficacious. The pride of
the slave, who is obliged to appear abroad with his back covered
with scars, is at first much hurt; but the shame of being seen in
this state soon wears off, and then all hopes of reform may be given
up; he will continue in his faults, and be indifferent to the stripes
which he must occasionally undergo for committing them. I have
been requested by slaves, who had been often so treated, to punish
them with the whip, and not to make them endure the misery of
sitting in the stocks in solitary confinement. But the punishment is
suffered in private; no exposure is occasioned by it. It would
appear strange that the slave should prefer corporal punishment; and
this would seem to denote that this class of men possesses none of those
feelings of shame of which I have spoken; but I am convinced, that
these are as deeply implanted in the negro, as in any other race of
human beings. The case is this, where a slave has been often punished
with the whip, and is seeing many of his companions and acquaintance
undergoing the same punishment frequently, the knowledge
that it is what he himself has before borne, and that so many are
thus treated, takes away the horror which he would otherwise feel at
the kind of chastisement. This proves the debased state,&mdash;the
very low ebb to which human nature may be brought. The additional
rigour which thus the slave seems to consider confinement
to be, would be a recommendation to some persons, and perhaps
the feeling is in the main right; for if the crime is great, the
punishment should be adequate, and by this means of confinement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span>
no degradation of the human being is occasioned. Hopes may be
entertained that the time which is given for reflection, and the
depression of spirits which is produced by the loneliness of the
situation, may bring about a correction of error; but by the whip,
angry and vindictive feelings are excited, or despair is the consequence,
and in either case the owner will be injured; in the former,
by a determination to continue in fault, and in the latter by
the death or inaction of the sufferer. The objection which is principally
to be urged against the mode of chastisement, which I have
accounted the least prejudicial to the slave, considered as a rational
being, is to be met with in the loss of time which is incurred by
confinement a due length; but I think, that this would be
much more than compensated by the loss of health and of character
which the negro suffers in undergoing punishment by the whip,
and even of time during the period that the slave is recovering
from the stripes. Iron collars, chains, and other punishments of the
same description are likewise made use of, and are liable to the
objection of rendering callous the sense of shame. I have observed,
and have often heard it remarked, that scarcely any of the slaves
who receive frequent correction, ever gain their freedom through
their own exertions. The bad dispositions and inclinations of
many, and the indifference which is produced in others by severe
punishments, sufficiently account for this fact.<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a></p>

<p>The creole slaves are usually employed as tradesmen and household
servants; even upon the sugar plantations this is the case
where they are not more numerous than what are necessary to fill
these departments; to the Africans the field labour is chiefly allotted.
The negroes are sent to work as the sun rises, and far
from being more capable of exertion in the early part of the morning
than under the mid-day heat, the Africans are inactive and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span>
languid, until the increasing power of the sun removes the chill
which they receive from the cool morning air. They frequently leave
their huts wrapped up in their coverlids of baize, seemingly much
distressed by the cold. The negroes breakfast about eight o’clock,
and for this meal half an hour or less is allowed; and some masters
expect that their slaves shall breakfast before they commence their
work in the morning;&mdash;that is, before sunrise. The time which is
allowed for dinner, is from twelve o’clock till two, when the
labourers again continue their labour until half past five o’clock.
They are now, generally speaking, expected to pick a small bundle
of grass for the master’s saddle-horses, in some of the neighbouring
provision grounds; but if this is not requisite, the work continues
until sunset, about six o’clock. On the arrival of the people at
home in the evening, they are sometimes required to scrape the
rind from the mandioc for about one or two hours; but as none of
the principal estates make a practice of selling the flour of the
mandioc, and only prepare the quantity which is necessary for the
subsistence of the slaves, this labour only occurs about once in each
week, or less frequently. In crop time, the work is only discontinued
on Sundays and holidays; and, as is practised on board
vessels at sea, the negroes relieve each other at stated hours.</p>

<p>The field negroes are attended by a <i>feitor</i> or driver, who is sometimes
a white man; but more frequently a free mulatto is employed
for the purpose. It is the practice likewise of some of the planters
to appoint a Creole, or even an African slave to the situation. Upon
a <i>feitor</i> who is a slave, more reliance is to be placed than upon a free
person of colour, for the slave <i>feitor</i> becomes responsible to his master
for the work which is to be executed, and is therefore careful that
every one should do his duty. It is a remark which is generally
made; that the slave <i>feitores</i> require to be watched, that they
may be prevented from being too rigorous towards those whom they
are appointed to command; their behaviour is usually more overbearing
than that of free men; and next to the slaves the European
<i>feitores</i> are the most tyrannical. It is likewise frequently observed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span>
that even manumitted Africans who become possessed of slaves,
which occasionally occurs, treat them in a severe and unfeeling manner,
that is nothing softened, but rather rendered more violent,
by a remembrance of their own sufferings. Experience in trouble
too often leads those who have suffered to the infliction of equal
or greater hardships, when opportunities for so doing are afforded;
the human being becomes callous; it is tormented, and torments with
the same indifference.</p>

<p>Medical attendance is not so well provided for as it ought, which
proceeds rather from the small number of practitioners in the country,
than from the negligence of the planters; indeed due attention
in this respect is so much and so evidently their interest, that
this alone, independent of any feelings of humanity, would make
them seek every means of obtaining proper advice for their slaves<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a>.
I do not think that the food which the slaves receive is in sufficient
quantities, or of a quality sufficiently nourishing for the labour which
they are required to perform; and it would be undoubtedly
much too scanty, if the days of intended rest did not supply them
with an addition to the stock of provisions which the master affords.
I have in another place stated, that the vegetable part of the food
of the sugar plantation negroes is chiefly the flour of the mandioc;
the animal food is generally the <i>carne do Searà</i>, salt meat which
comes from Rio Grande do Sul; and sometimes salt fish supplies its
place. The cloathing which is given to the slaves by the master
consists of a shirt and drawers of the cotton cloth of the country,
and a straw hat; a piece of baize and a mat are likewise afforded to
them; but these things are not renewed as often as a due consideration
to their comforts would demand. Although the negroes are
fed by their masters, still as lands are to be had in abundance, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span>
slaves are permitted to plant whatever they think fit, and to sell the
produce to whom they please. Many of them rear pigs and poultry,
and occasionally a horse is kept, from the hire of which money may
be obtained.<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a></p>

<p>The newly-imported negroes are usually sent to work too soon
after their arrival upon the estates; if proper care is taken of them,
they may indeed be employed in almost any description of labour at
the end of eight or ten months, but not much before this period.
Damp situations should be avoided, and they ought not to be sent
out in the morning earlier than eight o’clock, and they should breakfast
before they leave home: by these precautions the loss of many
slaves might be prevented; and they should be followed without any
deviation, at least until the new negroes have been for a twelvemonth
in the country to which they have been transported.<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a></p>

<p>I have represented slavery in what I conceive to be the state in
which it usually exists upon the plantations; but any comforts which
the human beings who are so circumstanced enjoy, and any respite
from severe labour is so entirely at the will of the master, that the
instances in which the fate of the slave is hard almost beyond endurance,
are dreadfully too frequent. Some planters follow the system<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span>
of performing certain kinds of work during the early part of the
night, besides making the negroes labour for the full usual time during
the day;&mdash;for instance, the whole of the labour of making the mandioc
flour, preparing with the feet the clay for making bricks and
earthenware, also building mud walls; besides removing bricks,
fire wood, and so forth from one place to another. This extra work
is called <i>quingingoo</i>. I even knew of one instance in which the field
labour was continued until twelve o’clock at night, by the light of
large fires which had been kindled in several parts of the ground.
For this manner of proceeding there was no reason, excepting that
it was the master’s pleasure so to act, for the season was favourable,
and not too far advanced to have continued the work in the usual
manner and yet have accomplished the planting of the field in proper
time. Of cruelty I could say much, but I have gone far enough, and
must not enter into farther details upon this part of my subject.
The relation of such misdeeds do more harm than good, they serve as
examples for those who have unprincipled minds and unfeeling
hearts; and who may consider them as paths in which they may tread,
because others have trodden in them, rather than as precipices which
ought to be avoided. The power which is entrusted to an individual
is too great, abuses must arise, the system is radically bad, and every
possible means should be put into action for its extirpation.</p>

<p>I am acquainted with the owners of a few estates who profess to
purchase any slaves however bad their characters may be, if they can
obtain them below the usual price. The persons of secondary rank
who possess only a few slaves, and have not the same means of
punishing them if they misbehave which exist upon the great estates,
dispose of those of their negroes who act improperly to the rich men
who will purchase them. There is an estate in the Mata, of which
the owner is known to buy any slave, however ill disposed he may
be, provided he can obtain him at a low price. This man manages
to keep his estate in the best order possible; every thing goes on
regularly upon it. He even prefers purchasing creole slaves to Africans,
although the former are invariably more difficult to manage.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span>
He is a man of determined character; on the arrival of one of these
new slaves, he takes him to the prison of the estate and shews him
the stocks, the chains, the whips, &amp;c. saying “this is what you are
to expect if you continue in your evil practices;” then a hut is given
to the slave; and also cloaths and other articles of comfort, all of
which are in a state of greater neatness, and are afforded in larger
quantities than are usually bestowed upon the slaves of other plantations.
On one occasion a negro struck the <i>feitor</i>, for which he was
immediately confined, until the matter could be investigated; the
freeman was found to be in fault, and was turned away. The negro
suffered a certain degree of punishment for striking a superior, but
he was ultimately appointed to the situation of <i>feitor</i>, having before
held that of second driver. If this planter did not rule his people
with great severity when guilty, his estate would soon become a den
of thieves and murderers, for it is well known of what bad materials
his gang of slaves is composed. This man is of mixed blood, but is
nearly related to some of the first families of the province. It is
well that a man should appear, who is willing, for the sake of a trifling
difference in the price for which he may obtain his labourers,
to take the trouble, and undergo the risk of person and of property
in controuling a set of uneducated men, who cannot consequently
have any principle of action, and whose habits are of the worst description.
According to present circumstances he is of service to
the country, for these fellows are kept quiet; but what a dreadful
state it is, that the institutions of a country should be so framed that
there should possibly exist in its centre, a body of human beings of
which many of the individuals are criminals; men, who certainly
never will be punished by the laws of the country, though punishment
may or may not be inflicted by the person to whom they are
subservient.</p>

<p>The slaves of the cotton estates undergo, as may be supposed, the
same kind of punishments, and are subject to the same species of
treatment as those which have already been spoken of; their management,
as in other parts, is conducted on the whole in a more lenient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span>
or more rigorous manner, according to the dispositions of the owners.
They are however liable to greater privations from the nature of the
country in which they reside, and they do not enjoy the benefit of
crop time, which is so favourable to the negroes of the sugar plantations.
Food is not so easily obtained in parts which are so distant
from great towns and from the sea-coast; and greater difficulty is
experienced in the sale of the mandioc, the beans and the maize
which the slaves raise upon their own provision grounds. Still the
negroes of the cotton districts sometimes gain their freedom by their
own exertions, for as cotton is a most lucrative plant, and yet may
be cultivated and brought to market with little or no out-lay of money,
those of the slaves who plant regularly and gather their trifling quantities,
frequently in the end meet with the reward of their labours.
This is not the case with the sugar-cane, for in cultivating this plant assistance
is necessary, much work being required to be done within a
given time, owing to the seasons in planting it, and to the nature of
the cane when it ripens; and there is likewise the difficulty of having
it ground, and of receiving the proceeds, &amp;c. In the manufactory the
slave has not his property under his own eye; it passes through the
hands of many other individuals, and as there is no personal respect for
the owner of the property, nor any means of redress in case of injustice,
the slave has only a poor chance of being properly dealt with; the
above circumstances being those to which the culture of the sugar-cane
is subject, it is scarcely ever planted by slaves on their own
account.</p>

<p>The cattle districts employ few slaves, and these are occupied at
home, for scarcely any of them, unless they are Creoles, are deemed
capable of undertaking the more arduous employments of pursuing
the cattle, breaking in horses, &amp;c. The slaves remain in the huts to
attend to the less enterprising occupations. The climate of the
Sertam is accounted well adapted to the constitutions of the
Africans; sickly negroes are often purchased at reduced prices by
persons who reside in the interior, under the idea that the climate
will soon re-establish their health. The circumstance of the non-existence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span>
of the <i>chigua</i> or <i>bicho</i><a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a>, in the plains of the Sertam is of
much importance; for this insect is extremely injurious to some of
the negroes;&mdash;notwithstanding every precaution, the feet have in
some instances been destroyed by them. The <i>chigua</i> has more effect
upon the flesh of some persons than upon that of others; and the
subjects who are violently attacked by this insect, are sometimes
only preserved from being crippled by their removal to a part of the
country in which it does not exist. The dryness of the air and soil
of the Sertam generally removes agues of long standing, and likewise
the complaint which frequently proceeds from the ague, and is
called <i>amarellidam</i>, or yellowness. The Africans are seldom attacked
by the ague, but they have often the <i>amarellidam</i>.</p>

<p>In the back settlements, beyond the plains of the Sertam, bordering
upon the mountains where cotton is planted, and from which
the plains are in part supplied with food, the number of negroes is
becoming considerable. I have had opportunities of conversing with
negroes from the Sertam, and have invariably found that they preferred
their residence in the cattle districts even to a removal into
the country bordering upon the sea. The diet of the Sertam negro
is preferable to that of the plantation slave, so that this circumstance,
independently of all others, would make the former be
well aware of the superiority of his situation. Fresh beef and
mutton are the usual food of the Sertam slaves, but upon the plantations
these are rarely served out.</p>

<p>The most dreadful complaint to which negroes are subject more
than other descriptions of men, is that which, in the Columbian
islands is known under the name of <i>yaws</i>, and in Brazil by that of
<i>bobas</i>. I had opportunities of seeing it, and most loathsome is the
sight of the individuals who are afflicted with it. The body becomes
covered with large ulcers, the patient is reduced to a mere skeleton,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span>
and is rendered generally for a time quite helpless. The facility
with which it is communicated to others increases the distress of the
patient; for every precaution must be taken in separating the sufferer
to some distance from the other slaves. The adult who recovers
from it seldom enjoys as perfect health as before. The negroes
say that it gets into the bone; every change of weather is felt
by those who have had the disorder, although they are again accounted
in health, and in some cases the use of one or other of the limbs is
occasionally lost for a time. A certain diet must be observed for
many months after the disorder has apparently left the person who
has had it, for the purpose of preventing a relapse; and sometimes a
deviation from this, even some years after, will cause violent pains in
the joints. The following circumstances occurred under my own
eyes. A child belonging to one of my neighbours, whilst I resided
at Jaguaribe, was in the practice of coming to amuse itself with some
of the children of the plantation. He had this disorder upon him;
and soon afterwards the son of a labourer caught it; all this was not
made known to me, until a slave of eight years of age was reported
to me to have the <i>bobas</i>; and shortly afterwards an old man, the
father of this child, likewise fell sick. In the course of a short
time, notwithstanding every care was taken, other persons were
afflicted with the disease. A surgeon was applied to, and he prescribed
mercury to all the patients. An infant of a few months old,
which afterwards caught the disease, underwent the same treatment.
The children who had arrived at a certain age all recovered, and
until the period of my departure, they had never experienced any
return, nor had felt any bad effects from it. The old man still
laboured under it, but was recovering. The growth of the infant
was stopped by the disease, and very little hopes were entertained of
saving its life.</p>

<p>This horrible disorder is contracted by inhabiting the same
room with the patient, and by inoculation; this is effected by means
of a small fly, from which every precaution is oftentimes of no avail.
Great numbers of the insects of this species appear early in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></span>
morning; but they are not so much seen when the sun is powerful.
If one of them chances to settle upon the corner of the eye or
mouth, or upon the most trifling scratch, it is enough to inoculate
the <i>bobas</i>, if the insect comes from a person who labours under the
disease. The same person can only have the <i>bobas</i> once. The scars
which it leaves upon the bodies of the negroes have a most disgusting
appearance; for the wounds have in some cases been of such
long standing, and have penetrated so deep as to have changed the
colour of the skin, which becomes of a most loathsome white colour.<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a>
However, deep wounds of any description have the same effect upon
the negro skin.</p>

<p>There are considerable numbers of white persons and of colour
who possess two or three slaves, and share with them the daily
labour, even of the field. These slaves are, generally speaking,
creoles, who have been reared in the family, or they are Africans
who have been purchased very young for a trifling sum of money;
they are frequently considered as part of the family, and
share with the master the food for which both are working. These
slaves appear on gala days well-dressed, and they have a certain
air of independence, which shews that they think themselves to be
something more in the world than mere drudges. The difference of
the feeling of one of these men towards his master, and that of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span>
generality of the slaves which are owned by great proprietors, is very
striking. The former will not suffer in his presence a word to be
spoken against his master, whilst the latter cares not if he hears
every injurious epithet made use of. The slaves of small proprietors
are not so liable to imbibe many of the faults to which those
of wealthy men are subject, and they possess more pride,&mdash;a greater
wish to act honourably,&mdash;a greater dread of being upbraided for a
fault. Upon large estates the assemblage of so many persons tends
to depravation, and the wide distance which there is between the
slave and the master tends to produce a greater feeling of inferiority;
but among the small proprietors the difference of rank is
infinitely less, owing, among other causes, to the assistance which
they receive from each other, in their daily occupations.<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a></p>

<p>From the vastness of the country, it might be supposed that if a
slave escapes from his master, the chances would be against his return,
but this is not the case. The Africans particularly are generally
brought back; they are soon distinguished by their manner of
speaking the Portugueze language; and if any one of them cannot
give a good account of himself, he will not be allowed to remain
long unmolested, for the profit arising from the apprehension of
a runaway slave is considerable. Besides, the manumitted
African generally continues to reside in the neighbourhood of the
estate upon which he has served as a slave; so that when a man of
this description, that is, an African, comes without being known, to
settle in a district, suspicion immediately arises that he is not free.
The manumitted creoles remove to where they are not known, because
they do not wish that the state in which they were born should
reach their new place of residence. An African must have been
brought to Brazil as a slave, and therefore his situation of a freeman
proves that his character is good, or he could not have obtained his
liberty; but a creole may have been born free, and consequently his
former state as a slave he wishes to conceal. Creole slaves, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[441]</a></span>
more especially mulattos, often do escape, and are never afterwards
heard of by their masters; but even these are sometimes brought
back.</p>

<p>A case of great hardship occurred at Recife a short time before I
left that place. A negro and his wife had escaped, and as their master
had not received any tidings of them for sixteen or seventeen
years, he supposed that both of them had died. However, one day
there arrived at his door in Recife, a number of <i>capitaens-do-campo</i>
with several persons in custody. He soon recognized his negro and
negress, and was told that the five young persons who were with
them were their children, and consequently his slaves. These poor
creatures had been brought up until this period of their lives with the
idea that they were free; and thus a young man of sixteen, and his
sister of fourteen years of age, were at the season of joy and gladness
to commence a life of misery. The master confined them all,
until he could dispose of them to some slave-dealer, which he soon
accomplished, and they were shipped from Recife for Maranham.
I never heard how the discovery had been made, that these people
were not free. Oh! system accursed, which thus damps the hopes and
prospects of a whole life.</p>

<p>Some of the negroes who escape determine to shun the haunts
of man, they conceal themselves in the woods, instead of attempting
to be received into some distant village as free persons. They
form huts, which are called <i>mocambos</i>, in the most unfrequented spots,
and live upon the game and fruit which their places of retreat afford.
These persons sometimes assemble to the number of ten or twelve,
and then their dislodgement is difficult; for their acquaintance with
the woods around gives them the advantage over any party which
may be sent to attack them<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a>. Sometimes a whole neighbourhood is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span>
disturbed by one of these communities, who rob the provision
grounds, steal calves<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a>, lambs and poultry; and stories are told of the
<i>Gabam</i> negroes stealing children.</p>

<p>The slaves of Maranham are in a less favourable state than those of
Pernambuco, on the whole; but the system which is followed respecting
them is radically the same. Their food is usually rice,
which is said to disagree with most of the nations which come from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[443]</a></span>
Africa; and the treatment which they receive upon the estates in
that part of the country, is said to be more rigorous; but of this I cannot
myself speak, for I had no opportunities of judging.</p>

<p>Negroes who are decidedly of incorrigible character, are shipped
from Pernambucco to Maranham, and though the cause for which
these transportations are made, is well known, they are often sold to
great advantage. Nothing tends so much to keep a slave in awe,
as the threat of sending him to Maranham or to Parà.</p>

<p>That the general character of persons who are in a state of slavery
should be amiable, and that goodness should predominate, is not to
be expected; but we ought rather to be surprised at the existence
of that degree of virtue which is to be found among those who are
reduced to a situation of so much misery. Slaves are much inclined
to pilfer, and particularly towards their masters this is very frequent;
indeed many of them scarcely think that they are acting improperly
in so doing<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a>. Drunkenness is common among them<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a>. A direct
answer is not easily obtained from a slave, but the information
which is required is learnt by means of four or five questions put in
various ways. The necessity for this is frequently caused by stupidity,
or from ignorance of the language in which the slave is
addressed, rather than from any wish to deceive. It is in their behaviour
to their families and companions, that the good part of the
human being is displayed, and natural enough it is that it should be
so. The negroes shew much attachment to their wives and children,
to their other relations if they should chance to have any, and to their
<i>malungos</i> or fellow passengers from Africa. The respect which is
paid to old age, it is extremely pleasing to witness. Superannuated
Africans, upon the estates, are never suffered to want any comforts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span>
with which it is in the power of their fellow slaves to supply them.
The old negroes are addressed by the term of <i>pai</i> and <i>mai</i>, father
and mother. The masters likewise add this term to the name
of their older slaves, when speaking to them. That the generality
of the slaves should shew great attachment to their masters, is not
to be expected; why should they? The connection between the two
descriptions of persons, is not one of love and harmony, of good
producing gratitude, of esteem and respect; it is one of hatred and
discord, of distrust, and of continual suspicion; one of which the
evil is so enormous, that if any proper feelings exist in those who
are supposed to benefit from it, and in those who suffer under it,
they proceed from our nature, and not from the system.</p>

<p>It will be seen from the above statement, that the slaves of those
parts of Brazil which I have had opportunities of seeing, are more
favourably situated than those of the Columbian islands; but still
they are slaves, and in this word is included, great misery, great degradation,
great misfortune.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XX.</h2>

<p class="pch">IMPOLICY OF THE SLAVE TRADE.</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">FEW persons in Great Britain have now any doubts of the inhumanity
of the slave trade, and none would presume to come
forwards as its defenders. It is a great moral evil, perhaps the
greatest in the world, from which England has at last been delivered.
But her work is not yet done, other nations continue to
transport the natives of Africa from their own shores to those of
South America; and even when her efforts have succeeded in persuading
them to forbid this trade, the plan of abolition must be followed
up in her own colonies; she must atone for the crimes which
she has committed, and prove to other countries her sincerity in the
cause, by her zeal in rooting out a most execrable system with all
prudent and possible expedition.</p>

<p>In Brazil there are several excellent men who still entertain the
idea that the Africans are saved from death by the slave-dealers, and
that if they were not purchased by Europeans, their countrymen
would murder them; this <i>was</i> the opinion in England a few years
ago, and therefore we cannot be surprised that the Brazilians should
still consider it as being founded upon truth. It is their interest so
to think, (or at any rate, they imagine that it is their interest) and
they have no books or other means by which they might be undeceived.
To the planters I fear that scarcely any arguments would be
of any avail; they imagine that without slaves their estates must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[446]</a></span>
decay, and therefore they fortify themselves under the notion of the
humanity of the trade by which they obtain their supplies. If the
chief body of the priests could be convinced of its cruelty,&mdash;of the
effect which this trade has to render still more prominent than they
would otherwise be, the bad qualities of the natives of Africa in their
own country, and to check every thing that is good;&mdash;of its direct
tendency to increase the manifold evils of the state of society existing
in the parts of that continent which are subject to the resort of slave-dealers;&mdash;if
the clergy could be made to believe that by their voice
they were sanctioning one of the most shocking systems under which
the world ever laboured, I know that their aid would be given to
the abolition. I am aware likewise of the weight which their
opinions carry with them among all other descriptions of persons.
One of the chief arguments with the priesthood is the advantages
which the Africans receive from their entrance into the Catholic
church;&mdash;how much better would it be to teach them the Christian
religion upon their native soil, without all the miseries to which they
are subjected by their transportation!</p>

<p>Another opinion has also been adopted, which induces the Brazilians
to suspect the motives of Great Britain in urging their
government to abolish the trade. They say it was from policy
alone that she abolished the slave trade, because her colonies were
fully stocked; and that now she wishes to accomplish the abolition
among all other nations who are not so well provided with labourers,
that they may not rival her transatlantic possessions, and
ultimately surpass them by the increased number of workmen<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a>. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[447]</a></span>
is clear that those who hold out that upon such principles as these
the abolition was effected in England, know nothing of its history;&mdash;for
if they did, they would soon see from what pure motives the zeal
for the prohibition of the slave-trade proceeded; they would read of
the exertions and perseverance of Clarkson, the great apostle in this
cause, and they would be convinced that the eloquence of Wilberforce
could only emanate from the most disinterested sources. It would
be perceived that these two individuals whose names will for ever
be connected with the famous law to the passing of which they contributed
so materially, were followed by a train of advocates in this
glorious struggle, whose aid was afforded under circumstances which
were as little liable to suspicion as the conduct of their great leaders.
The proofs of the unstained principles upon which this act was carried
through Parliament are so decisive, that a plain statement of
facts would convince all those who were not previously determined to
believe the contrary.</p>

<p>The government of Brazil has a difficult part to act; it rules a
numerous body of slave-owners, who are scattered over a very extensive
country, in which the authority of the sovereign will only
of necessity be loosely recognized; the possibility of resisting his
commands does exist, and though his mandates are issued in the
style of despotism, still he must be careful not to go too far; for he
has not the means of enforcing obedience to his edicts in the chief
provinces, if any one of them chose to withdraw its allegiance. The
government would be, I rather think, inclined to follow the example
of the chief powers of Europe; but it must not be precipitate, the
people must be prepared for the change, and have time given<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[448]</a></span>
them to think upon a subject, which, under their present impressions,
is supposed to injure them so materially. It is at Bahia
that the slave-dealers and planters have shewn themselves most
violent in favour of the slave-trade; it is from that place that the
most extensive traffic is carried on to the coast of Africa. In the
province of Bahia there are great estates, possessing two, three, and
four hundred slaves; the owners of these are consequently rich, and
they possess power over the free population as well as over their
own immediate dependents. It is in that quarter that the greatest
inclination to resist whatever its people does not relish, has been experienced.
Petitions containing forcible language have been made
to the government at Rio de Janeiro, against the abolition and against
the proceedings of the British cruisers stationed upon the coast of
Africa, by which several slave ships have been captured<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a>. The
government of Brazil may, and ought to be persuaded by all peaceable
and friendly means which independent States possess of urging
each other, to do its utmost in accomplishing the much to be desired
end; but still whatever our wishes may be, and however much the
inclinations of the Portugueze ministry may coincide with them,
they must consult the state of the country over which they rule.</p>

<p>A Brazilian writer who has published several pamphlets at Rio
de Janeiro with the permission of the Regent, has spoken against
the trade, as far as it is possible under present circumstances.
Slavery he styles “a terrible cancer in the body politic, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[449]</a></span>
tends to impede the increase of the white race,” and as he rather
quaintly expresses himself “to Africanize the New World<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a>.” This
is not the only place in which the same writer speaks of slavery,
and of the trade in these terms. A Portugueze writer of much reputation
among his countrymen, says, “if we have never feared the
power of the government, neither ought we to hesitate in combating
the erroneous opinions of the people; confident that although he
who opposes himself to the prejudices of a nation, renders his name
odious, still he may be quite certain that posterity will do him justice<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a>.”
Another Journal of equal reputation states, that “it is a great
evil for the chief strength of an empire to consist in the number of
its slaves; and if Brazil had once reflected, that each negro which
she exports from Africa, is necessarily an enemy whom she is
nurturing, she would perhaps not have dared to employ them at
all; or at any rate she would have made use of them in smaller
numbers<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a>.” I hope that other individuals of the same nation will
see the subject in the same light, and will give their assistance in
leading their countrymen to a knowledge of the equity, humanity,
and good policy of abolishing this detestable traffic.</p>

<p>The ruin of Brazil is predicted, the decay of its agriculture and
of its commerce are supposed to be inevitable from the want of
labourers if the trade is prohibited. This is generally asserted
wherever I have been, without the least consideration, without a
thought being given to the possibility of employing the free population
of the country in daily labour. It is said, that if Africans are
not to be obtained, every thing must be at a stand, and the country
can make no progress. This argument against the abolition, the Brazilians
bring forwards even with much less plausibility than the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[450]</a></span>planters of the Columbian islands. In these the number of free
persons of colour, is comparatively very small, whereas in Brazil, a
great proportion of the population consists of free persons in the lower
ranks of life. In some parts of the country which I have visited, the
free people preponderate considerably, and in none of those districts
which I saw, do I conceive that the slaves outnumber the free
people in a greater proportion than three to one. It will have been
seen from foregoing chapters, that the sugar plantations are not
largely stocked with slaves, and that no estate is without some
portion of its lands which are occupied by families who are in a state
of freedom. The villages too contain free persons almost exclusively,
and even in the large towns, the major part of the
mechanics are free.</p>

<p>The slave trade is impolitic with regard to Brazil on the broad
principle, that a man in a state of bondage will not be so serviceable
to the community as one who acts for himself, and whose whole
exertions are directed to the advancement of his own fortune, the
increase of which, by regular means, adds to the general prosperity
of the society to which he belongs. This is an undoubted and indisputable
fact, to which every person assents, owing to the self-evidence
of its truth; and which must be still more strongly imprinted
on the mind of every one who has been in the habit of
seeing the manner in which slaves perform their daily labour.
Their indifference, and the extreme slowness of every movement,
plainly point out the trifling interest which they have in the
advancement of the work. I have watched two parties labouring in
the same field, one of free persons, and the other of slaves, which
occasionally, though very seldom, occurs. The former are singing,
joking, and laughing, and are always actively moving hand and foot;
whilst the latter are silent, and if they are viewed from a little distance,
their movements are scarcely to be perceived.</p>

<p>Even if Brazil had only to depend upon its slaves for the increase
of its agriculture and population, it would still be better for that
country in the main, to put a stop to the introduction of Africans;
but in that case, although its advancement would necessarily be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[451]</a></span>
progressive, it would be slow. Every African who enters the
country is an enemy of which the State is sanctioning the introduction.
Besides Brazil is not in want of them, and even if that
country made the greatest possible use of every individual whom it
at present possesses, (which it does not,) and yet urgently and necessarily
required an additional number of hands to continue the cultivation
of the lands, the transportation of Africans is the worst
manner of obtaining them, even in a political point of view. If,
however, upon Africans <i>alone</i> its advancement was to depend, many
years must pass before any great change would be seen in its riches
and power, and consequently in its progress to the rank of a great
nation. Brazil is, however, in a far different situation; her free population
is numerous, and the time seems to have almost arrived, when
this part of the community would take its proper place in society in
spite of existing regulations<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a>. So much do I imagine this to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[452]</a></span>
be the case, that I think the abolition of the slave trade would
scarcely be felt at Pernambuco after the first moment; and even any
sensation which might be caused, would rather be produced artificially
than necessarily. The rich slave owners would immediately
rival each other in the purchase of the Africans who might happen
to be on sale, and thus an increase of price would be produced; but
the number of free persons is quite adequate to fill up any vacuum
which it is supposed would be caused in the country by a stop being
put to the supply of the imported part of the population.</p>

<p>Constituted as society is in civilized states, the poor must depend
upon those who are sufficiently wealthy to give them employment;
and again, the latter must depend upon the former for the execution
of their projects. But the situation of Brazil excludes the lower
ranks from the aid of those who are above them, and deprives the
rich of the assistance which they might receive from the labour of the
poor. The peasant is under the necessity of planting for his own
subsistence, without possessing the capital which is requisite for the
undertaking. If the crop fails he remains totally destitute. The
exertions of a number of individuals each occupied singly in clearing
and cultivating separate plots of land, cannot accomplish so
easily, or with so much perfection, the work which might be done
by the united efforts of the same number of persons. Even if the slave
trade was to continue for a considerable length of time, the natural
order of things would probably have their course, and free labourers
would be employed upon every well regulated estate conjointly
with the slaves. The lower ranks of people would become too
numerous for each family to be able to possess a sufficient quantity
of land for its own support, and this would oblige them to hire
themselves to those who could afford to pay them; the planters
would see the advantages of hiring their workmen, and thus, without
any care or attention to this most important subject by the government
of the country, would the labour of freemen be admitted.
By the separation of labour into small spots of cultivated ground,
(if cultivated it can be called) as is practised at present, great portions
of land are wasted, and only a few families can possibly exist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[453]</a></span>
upon the extent of surface, (each working for itself) which would
give bread to a much greater number of persons, if they were
employed conjointly;&mdash;if the labour was paid for by one who wished
to obtain a good crop from the land, could pay for the work which
was requisite, and gave the necessary attention to its culture; this
would bring together and render useful to each other, the first class
of people who enjoy considerable wealth, and the third class who
do not possess any thing. The second class consisting of small
planters, who live comfortably, have a decent house, three or four
slaves, a horse or two and some other trifling property, would not be
affected in the least by this change in the application of the labour
of the class which is immediately below them. The secondary
people, who cannot afford to increase their number of slaves, and
yet are not able to accomplish their projects in planting with those
which they possess, frequently hire free labourers.</p>

<p>Under the present system, the labour of free persons is not placed
to the greatest advantage; their time is misemployed in performing
alone with great difficulty, what would be done easily if several persons
were occupied together. This is particularly apparent in a new
country, where the obstacles which are to be surmounted in preparing
lands for culture are so numerous and of such magnitude. If
a man is aware that the obtaining of his daily bread depends directly
upon the exertions of each day, it is probable that he will be careful
in making use of the present moment, and not put off until the
morrow what will so materially benefit him; and as he knows that
his comforts depend upon his regular exertions, he will be more inclined
to go through his daily occupations with punctuality. But if
his gains do not correspond with the work which he does daily, the
probability is that some carelessness will be perceived; and he will,
from trifling causes, delay the performance of a task until a future
moment. The hire which a labourer in the service of another man
receives, is only rendered to him if he has performed his allotted
work, otherwise the time is lost; no good fortune, no lucky season
can reclaim it; but if his profits are expected to be meted to him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[454]</a></span>
rather from the richness of the land which he has cultivated, from a
favourable season, from the excellence of the seed, or from these
causes combined, or from others which are not under his controul,
he will more willingly stay idling at home, or accept an invitation to
a merriment-making. Labour is not pleasant; men in general work
from necessity, and therefore some stimulant is requisite to urge them
to exertion; this occurs in any climate, and holds good still more
frequently in one which naturally inclines to the indulgence of indolent
propensities.<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a></p>

<p>If all men were free, the capital which is required in the establishment
of a plantation, or the great exertions which, under existing
circumstances, must be used to answer the payments which are to
be made for the property obtained on credit would not be so necessary;
or at any rate the experiment of entering into schemes for
planting would not be so dangerous as it is at present, if the chief
expenditure was not incurred in property which is so precarious and
at the same time so valuable as slaves. In the purchase of any
other description of live stock (to speak in creole language), the risk
lies in diseases of the body only, and in those alone to which
bodies that are inured to the climate are subject; but you transplant
the negro from his native soil, which to him is the best in the
world; and you have his wounded and desponding mind to heal.
The vexations and privations which he must undergo are to be
combated; his mind as well as his body must be kept in health,
or little service will his master receive from him. The loss which
is occasioned by untimely deaths would not, if free men were employed,
thus fall directly upon the planter. The time which is passed
by the runaway-slave in the woods, or residing in temporary freedom
at some distant village, would not be so much property unemployed.
The expences attendant upon sickness, and the loss of time proceeding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[455]</a></span>
from the same cause, would be incurred by the patient, and
the place of one individual would be occupied by another. The
constant anxiety of the planter which is caused by the bad habits of
his slaves, and from other reasons inseparably connected with the
system by which one man rules a body of his fellow-creatures who
are at the same time his property, would be removed. The owner
of an estate might have some rest; his attention need not be entirely
given up to the management of his affairs, which must now be
the case, if he has a wish to advance his fortune, and a due regard for
the preservation in an able state, of the beings through whose means
this is to be accomplished. Too true it is that men become callous
to the constant round of intelligence which is communicated by the
manager; of slaves sick, lamed by accident, making their escape, &amp;c.
and the accounts of their recovery and return are received with the
same unconcern. Punishment is ordered for crimes and misdemeanors
with the same insensibility; all these are things of course,
and as such are endured quietly.</p>

<p>In a country which is afflicted with the dreadful disease of slavery
cruelty is frequent, and whilst the punishment of misdemeanors which
have been committed against the master are generally immediate
and proportioned to their bearing upon the interests of the superior,
it is difficult to compass the chastisement of great crimes against
the community. It is the interest of the master to conceal from the
superior authorities those actions of their slaves which might subject
them to the loss of their services. Instances have occurred in
which the law itself has swerved from its direct line of justice, that
the owner might not be injured by the execution or transportation of
the slave. It is for the benefit of the wealthy man, who ought to be
the dispenser of justice, to act contrary to what it is his duty to do;
to counteract the principles of rectitude, to screen from their deserts
the evil deeds of a great portion of the population of the country in
which he resides. He is silent concerning his neighbours’ property,
that like forbearance may be practised towards himself, if he should
require it. But the crimes which slaves commit without the knowledge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[456]</a></span>
of their masters, or those which, although they may be afterwards
known to the owners, have been committed without their concurrence,
are not the only evil actions into which this class of men
may be led. The owner himself who has not courage to revenge his
own quarrels, may command that his purpose shall be accomplished
by one of the wretched individuals over whom he rules. This has
absolutely happened.</p>

<p>The general tendency which is produced by slavery, taken in every
point of view, is to rouse all the bad qualities of him who rules and
of him who endures; by this system, a government permits the demoralization
of its people, and that the property of its subjects be laid
out in a most disadvantageous manner; a great number of individuals
must be supported whose benefit to the state is much decreased
by the situation in which they are placed, and another class in society
is prevented from taking its due share in the general advancement
of the country.</p>

<p class="pch">THE TREATIES OF FRIENDSHIP AND ALLIANCE, AND OF COMMERCE AND NAVIGATION,
BETWEEN THE CROWNS OF GREAT BRITAIN AND PORTUGAL, SIGNED
AT RIO DE JANEIRO, ON THE 19th OF FEBRUARY 1810.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">I HAVE heard many discussions both in England and in Brazil,
upon the merits and demerits of these Treaties; in such disputations
Englishmen have appeared to suppose that their interests had not
been sufficiently consulted; and the contrary opinion was maintained
by the Portugueze, for they considered their nation to be aggrieved by
them, and that great partiality had been shown to British subjects. I
cannot avoid thinking that the Treaties are as impartial as possible,
and that due regard has been paid to both parties. If British subjects
have gained some advantages, one of considerable importance
which they possessed before, has been given up; and the commercial
intercourse between both parties has been placed in very
favourable circumstances. Even the innovations which by these
Treaties have been made in the laws of Brazil in favour of Englishmen,
tend to the general advancement of that country,&mdash;to forward
its progress towards a higher pitch of civilization. In the discussions
which I have heard, Englishmen, by the arguments which they
used, appeared to think that Brazil should have been treated overbearingly,
as a country which had been humbled by misfortune, and
that of this circumstance advantage should have been taken by
Great Britain. The idea which is entertained of the weakness of
Brazil, must proceed from the trifling defensive preparations which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[458]</a></span>
are to be seen upon her coasts. Her sea-ports might no doubt be
much injured by attacks from a maritime enemy; but the country
is impregnable, it possesses far stronger fortresses than any which
can be raised by man; in its extent, in its woods, and in a hardy
population, who are accustomed to live on very little food, and
that of a poor kind. However, any ideas of conquest in South
America by Europeans, against the wishes of the people, experience
has proved to be fallacious; the Dutch war with Pernambuco, and
our own errors at Buenos Ayres bear witness to this fact.</p>

<p>The Portugueze on the other hand seem to have imbibed the
idea that Great Britain has taken undue advantage of the state of
the Portugueze monarchy, and has imposed heavy terms, such as
suited her own purposes. Many of the arguments which are made
use of by the Portugueze, are brought forwards by them without any
consideration of the state of Brazil;&mdash;of the relative situation of the
two high contracting parties. The following plea for complaint, although
it does not relate to the Treaties, may be mentioned in this place, for it
is a favourite one with many persons. It is said, that the Regent of
Brazil has made grants of land to British subjects, but that the Portugueze
are not permitted to possess landed property in the dominions of
His Britannic Majesty. A complaint of this kind would appear to denote
that the two countries were in the same state with regard to population;
that Brazil did not require an enormous increase of people, and
that Great Britain possessed a superabundance of territory. Far from
the grants of land to foreigners being urged as a breach of the declared
reciprocity between the two nations, the government of Brazil ought
to invite foreigners to purchase lands and establish themselves
there; it ought to allow them to follow their own religion; it should
naturalize them and fix them to the soil by the protection which
the laws ought to afford them; and by the permission which should
be given to them of having some share in the concerns of the
society into which they had been adopted.</p>

<p>The Portugueze are continually pointing to the rapid advancement
of the United States of America, and holding up that country as an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[459]</a></span>
example which ought to be followed in the introduction of minor
improvements in Brazil; but they do not seek high enough for the
sources of the prosperity of North America; the statesmen of that
country receive every one who pleases to establish himself under
their protection, and the laws of the republic tolerate all religions; these
are the great fountains from which the increase of her power has
been drawn. An impartial distribution of justice, and a mildness of
government have acted in unison with the views of her rulers.
Brazil however is totally unfit for a republican form of government;
<i>her</i> people have been guided in a far different track from that of the
inhabitants of the United States. The first settlers in North
America left their native shores, because their ideas were too democratic
for the mother country, and because their religious opinions
did not coincide with those of their countrymen; therefore the
minds of the descendants of parents like these were prepared for the
declaration of republican principles. But the colonists of Brazil
were regularly invited to settle under the direction of officers who
had been appointed by the government of Portugal, and who were
entrusted with despotic power; they were Roman Catholics too.
Consequently the habits of their descendants lead them to quiet
acquiescence in the mandates of those who govern them; to follow
rather than to direct, to be guided rather than to be obliged all at
once without any previous instruction, to think for themselves.
Still, although a government which is established on principles of
democracy is not suited to Brazil, that country would bear many
degrees of advancement towards a state of freedom,&mdash;in religion, in
personal security, and in legislative authority; this last might
certainly be granted to a certain degree.<a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a></p>

<p>However to return; I shall attempt to prove that the Treaties in
question have been fairly drawn out, and that they exist for the benefit
of both nations; that each has conceded in some points much to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[460]</a></span>
the well-being of both. Neither party should desire to have every
thing, from whence, says a Brazilian writer, “arise conflicts, hatreds,
and the pretences upon which complaints and wars are founded.”<a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a></p>

<p>The Portugueze canvass the Treaties as if they were jealous of what
had been granted to British subjects, without considering whether
the advantages which had been conceded were or were not for the
benefit of Brazil. They should consider what is for their own good,
and not what Great Britain grants to them, or what their government
grants to Great Britain.</p>

<p>I shall only mention those articles of the Treaties which are particularly
interesting, and which may be liable to discussion, wishing
to be as observant of conciseness as possible.</p>

<h3 class="p2">THE TREATY OF FRIENDSHIP AND ALLIANCE.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">I pass</span> over the primary articles as being unimportant, or from the
interest of the subjects to which they relate having already subsided.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Article</span> 6th. “His Britannic Majesty is allowed the privilege of
causing timber, for the purpose of building ships of war, to be purchased
and cut down in the woods of Brazil.”</p>

<p>This was supposed to afford to Great Britain an inexhaustible
and inexpensive source of supplying her navy with timber; but I
have understood that the expence which must be incurred in felling
the trees, and bringing the timber to the water’s edge, would be too
great to render the project feasible; and that the woods of Brazil
were discovered to contain a less proportion of valuable timber than
had been imagined. If the British government had thought proper
to act upon this article,&mdash;if the plan had been judged worthy of being
executed, the advantages which Brazil must have derived from it
would have been considerable. The increased traffic which would
have been experienced by the ports in which dock-yards would have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[461]</a></span>
been established, and the number of mechanics who would have
gone over, many of whom would in all probability have remained
ultimately in that country, must have been beneficial to it. The ship
carpenters and caulkers of Brazil are fully as good as those of
England, and if encouragement was given to the most necessary art
of ship-building, no external aid would be requisite. But due encouragement
is what is wanting.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Article</span> 7th. “Any squadron that may be sent by either of the High
Contracting Parties to the succour of the other, shall be supplied with
fresh provisions by that power for whose assistance it is fitted out.”
This plainly alludes to the British squadron stationed at Rio de
Janeiro for the protection of the coast of Brazil; and it is only fair
that the party which is assisted should feed those who have undertaken
its defence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Article</span> 8th. “Any number of ships of war are permitted to
enter the ports of either of the High Contracting Parties.” This
is connected with the foregoing article, and was necessary for its
execution.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Article</span> 9th. “The Inquisition or Tribunal of the Holy Office
not having been hitherto established or recognized in Brazil, H.R.H.
the Prince Regent of Portugal, guided by an enlightened and liberal
policy, takes the opportunity afforded by the present treaty, to declare
spontaneously in his own name, and in that of his heirs and successors,
that the Inquisition shall never hereafter be established in
the South American dominions of the Crown of Portugal.”</p>

<p>A hint is thrown out towards the conclusion of the same article
of some intention to abolish the Inquisition in Portugal, and in all
other parts of the Portugueze dominions. I imagine that Great
Britain would scarcely have stipulated for this change of policy in
the government of Brazil, if some intimation had not been made
that the ministry of that country wished in this manner to get rid of
the abominable tribunal. Great Britain indeed cannot be said to have
stipulated for it; the Prince declares his purpose <i>spontaneously</i>. Be
this as it may, this most horrible Court does not exercise its power<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[462]</a></span>
in Brazil, and thus has been removed, almost irrevocably, one of the
most intolerable burthens under which any nation ever laboured.
The late Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, D. Rodrigo de
Souza Coutinho, was a man of a liberal mind; and Brazil has in his
death sustained a great loss; but this misfortune is alleviated by the
means which it has afforded of placing at the head of affairs the
Chevalier Araujo<a name="FNanchor_259_259" id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a>. This nobleman seems to have adopted Brazil
as his country, to direct his attention entirely to the concerns of that
kingdom, and to wish to increase the importance of the State over
which he has been most judiciously placed. He appears also to be
aware of the means by which progressive prosperity is to be obtained,&mdash;liberality,
toleration, mildness, reformation. The solemn
manner in which the rulers of Brazil have declared their intentions
in this respect, is a triumph of liberality over bigotry which was
scarcely to be expected; and still less was the public avowal of principles
like these to be looked for from the quarter in which they
appeared. The misfortunes of Portugal have produced incalculable
benefit to the transatlantic territories which she held under subjection;
and although the mother country has suffered much, still some
advantages cannot fail to proceed from the change in her situation;
at any rate her internal affairs may meet with some alterations which
may better the condition of the people. Portugal no longer enjoys
the exclusive trade with Brazil, but I know not whether in the end
she will not be happier in depending upon her own resources;&mdash;upon
a moderate trade with other nations suited to her political
importance, instead of the gigantic commercial intercourse
which was carried on through her ports. The government
will probably undergo some reform, and Portugal will in all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[463]</a></span>
likelihood soon see the Inquisition abolished, and may perhaps witness
the re-establishment of the Cortes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Article</span> 10th. “A gradual abolition of the slave trade on the part
of the Regent of Portugal is promised, and the limits of the same
traffic along the coast of Africa are determined.” Of this subject I
have already in another place treated.</p>

<h3 class="p2">THE TREATY OF COMMERCE AND NAVIGATION.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Article</span> 2d. “There shall be reciprocal liberty of commerce and
navigation between the subjects of the two High Contracting Parties,
and they are allowed to trade, travel, sojourn, and establish themselves
in the ports &amp;c. of the dominions of each, excepting in those from
which all foreigners are excluded.”</p>

<p>The ease with which leave to travel in Brazil may be obtained, I
have myself experienced, and even without a passport an Englishman
might travel in some of the provinces. Great complaint has been
made by the Portugueze of the strictness with which the British Alien
Laws have been enforced; and here a breach of reciprocity is stated to
exist,&mdash;not by the Treaty, but in the non-accomplishment of this article.
The extreme difficulty with which one foreigner is distinguished
from another, by persons who do not understand the language of any,
and the vicinity of Great Britain to the Continent of Europe,&mdash;to her
greatest enemy, and the immense number of foreign prisoners which
she held in confinement during the war, placed her in a far different
situation from Brazil, in which the only foreigners excepting Spaniards,
who could possibly have found their way into the country, must have
arrived there in British or Portugueze vessels, consequently little
doubt could be entertained of the propriety of allowing any foreigner
to receive a passport to travel in the interior or along the coast of that
country<a name="FNanchor_260_260" id="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a>. Difficulties were doubtless experienced, and vexations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[464]</a></span>
submitted to on some occasions, and these cases have been brought
forwards. It must be recollected that the number of Portugueze
subjects travelling in Great Britain was, and is, much greater than
that of British subjects travelling in Brazil; and that the number of
magistrates to whom each of these travellers must shew his pass is
much greater in the former country than in the latter, owing to the
more numerous population of Great Britain. Therefore a very few
cases of hardship in Brazil would only average a much greater number
of like instances of severity in Great Britain.<a name="FNanchor_261_261" id="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a></p>

<p>With respect to naturalization in the dominions of either of the
two crowns, the Portugueze are much more favourably situated than
British subjects, because, according to existing laws, a British subject
can only be naturalized in the kingdom of Portugal and Brazil, if he
professes the Roman Catholic Religion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Articles</span> 3d, 4th, and 5th. These relate to custom-house duties,
port-charges, &amp;c., which are to be paid with perfect reciprocity by the
vessels of both nations. If the same duties, at the custom-houses in
Brazil, were not paid for goods which were imported in British as
in Portugueze vessels, the consequences would be, that every
English merchant must resort to smuggling, or be obliged
to give up all idea of competition with the Portugueze. The
duty on cotton, the chief article which is exported from Brazil
to England, is equal in vessels of either nation. This duty is not
however of such importance to the commodity as to render the importer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[465]</a></span>
of it in a ship which pays a higher impost unable to vie with
him who pays a lower one. But in the case of manufactured goods
shipped from hence to Brazil, the duty is of primary consequence,
because there is very frequently, I may say generally, a loss upon
such shipments, and an increase of 10 <i>per cent.</i> upon a concern which
has independently of these 10 <i>per cent.</i> undergone a loss, would often
be ruinous. I have not a doubt in saying that the government of
Brazil is a gainer by lowering the duties upon goods which are imported
in British vessels to the standard of those which are imported
in vessels that are owned by its subjects. Under existing regulations
all parties come into the market upon an equal footing, and although
some persons will attempt to evade the payment of any duty, still it
is not necessary that a whole body of men should resort to smuggling
for the purpose of bringing their commodities into the market with
any prospect of a successful sale. I own that I think a higher duty
than 15 <i>per cent.</i> might be raised by government, but if any advance
was made it should be done generally upon all classes of traders,
whether subjects of Brazil or foreigners, to be done to any advantage.
The reciprocity which is established by these articles has been
followed by most advantageous consequences to both parties. Great
Britain is materially benefited in a commercial point of view by the
importation of the cotton of Brazil, direct from that country; and the
improvement which has been caused, and continues to act in Brazil
by the introduction of British manufactured goods is incalculable, in
point of wealth and civilization, and in producing incentives for exertion.</p>

<p>The latter part of the 5th Article determines which are the vessels
that shall be accounted British, and which shall be accounted Portugueze,
for the purpose of ascertaining those of both nations which
may enjoy the favourable stipulations. The Portugueze here again
complain that the English have the advantage over them from the
great numbers of vessels which they build, and from the numerous
prizes which they take from their enemies, whilst the Portugueze<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[466]</a></span>
construct very few vessels, and take no prizes<a name="FNanchor_262_262" id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a>. The Portugueze
have lately been in the habit of purchasing vessels that have been
built in the United States. As soon as these are owned by Portugueze
subjects, the national colours of the new owners may be hoisted, and
they enjoy all the privileges of vessels of Portugueze build. It is
urged that the British government should have suffered these vessels
to enter the ports of Great Britain enjoying the same advantages as
are granted to such vessels by the Portugueze government. If the
subject is considered it will be perceived that this would be equally
against the interest of both nations. Great Britain would by this
means afford a considerable market for the shipping of one of her
maritime rivals. By the low prices at which such vessels may be
obtained, and the small number of hands which they require, the
Portugueze navigation would likewise be materially injured. Instead
of any encouragement being given to ship-building in Brazil, the
subjects of that country would resort to North America for vessels,
and a bar would be placed against the advancement of this complicated
art, in a country possessing many advantages which adapt
it for the formation of a numerous navy.</p>

<p>The latter part of the 8th Article stands thus:&mdash;“But it is to be
distinctly understood that the present Article is not to be interpreted
as invalidating or affecting the exclusive right possessed by the crown
of Portugal within its own dominions to the farm for the sale of ivory,
brazil-wood, urzela, diamonds, gold dust, gunpowder, and tobacco, in
the form of snuff.” I hope that ere long the system of gradual reform
will reach these monopolies, and that the trade in the Articles which
they comprise will be thrown open.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Article</span> 10th. “British subjects resident in the Portugueze dominions
shall be permitted to nominate special magistrates to act for
them as judges-conservator.” This privilege is not conceded to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[467]</a></span>
Portugueze residing in Great Britain, and has therefore been complained
of. Every Portugueze well knows the dreadful state of the
courts of justice in all the dominions of his sovereign, and how extremely
difficult it is to obtain redress under any grievance. He
must be aware of the advantages which may be obtained by being
personally acquainted with the magistrate before whom a cause is to
be agitated. If this is the case (and that it is, speaking generally, no
one will deny) in causes among themselves, how much more necessary
is it that some protection should be afforded to foreigners, who cannot
have opportunities of using undue influence; and besides, where
the decision depends entirely upon one man, he will probably be inclined
to favour his own countrymen. “The acknowledged equity of
British jurisprudence, and the singular excellence of the British
Constitution,” as the same article of the Treaty observes, render unnecessary
any special magistrate to manage the concerns of foreigners
residing in Great Britain. The state of the British courts of law is
the pride of every Englishman; a doubt of the impartiality of their
decisions never strikes the mind of any reasonable man. Although
one party in the State constantly opposes the measures of government,
and seeks out any abuses which may have crept into its proceedings,
still the courts of law continue to act, year after year, without any
suspicion of misconduct,&mdash;without any idea of unfairness in their determinations
being entertained. I speak in this manner of Portugueze
courts of law, in the first place, from the radical badness of the
system by which the determination of a cause depends upon one man;
and in the second place, from the practice of one court, which I have
had opportunities of witnessing, and the general complaints of almost
every Portugueze who has had any thing to do with proceedings of
this description. Doubtless there must be some men who do their
duty; but a system of government should be founded upon the basis
of as near an approach as can be formed to the impossibility of misconduct,
and upon responsibility.</p>

<p>It is in the courts of law that a thorough change should be effected
in the Portugueze dominions; their corrupt state calls most loudly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[468]</a></span>
for reformation, and it is from this source that the existing government
has one heavy weight hanging over it, which may lead to most
serious consequences. There are two evils which cannot be long
endured when they have arrived at a certain height. Heavy and injudicious
taxation, and injustice;&mdash;these reach every man; in his own
hut he feels them, and they follow him every where, subjecting him
to privations, and to many mortifications; his temper is soured and
his anger will at last break loose.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Article</span> 12th. “British subjects, and all other foreigners resident
in the dominions of Portugal shall have perfect liberty of conscience,
and shall be permitted to build churches and chapels under certain
restrictions as to their outward appearance; and any person who
should attempt to make converts from, or should declaim against the
Catholic religion publicly, is to be sent out of the country in which
the offence has been committed.” It is disgraceful that such an
article as this should be necessary in any Treaty between two civilized
states; but every step towards liberality should be greeted with
great joy, proceeding from those countries in which the Catholic
religion predominates. That part of the article which concedes
liberty of conscience, not only to British subjects, but to every
foreigner, is another indication of the spirit of liberality having found
its way into the Council of Rio de Janeiro, for, I should imagine that
the British statesman would only have required this stipulation for his
countrymen, without mentioning the subjects of other powers. I
have heard this article much complained of by men who were afterwards
surprised to hear that the Portugueze were allowed to have
their chapels in England; and here these gentlemen would have
been desirous of preventing perfect reciprocity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Article</span> 17th. “It is agreed and covenanted that articles of military
and naval stores brought into the ports of H. R. H. the Prince
Regent of Portugal, which the Portugueze government may be desirous
of taking for its own use shall be paid for without delay at
the prices appointed by the proprietors, who shall not be compelled
to sell such articles on any other terms. And it is farther stipulated,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[469]</a></span>
that if the Portugueze government shall take into its own care and
custody any cargo or part of a cargo, with a view to purchase or
otherwise, the said Portugueze government shall be responsible for
any damage or injury that such cargo or part of a cargo may receive
while in the care and custody of the officers of the said Portugueze
government.”</p>

<p>I have transcribed this article at full length. What must be the
reputed state of a government from which common equity must be
stipulated for? But I trust that the time for such abuses has gone by,
and that the era of reformation has commenced.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Article</span> 18th. “The privilege is granted to British subjects of being
<i>assignantes</i> for the duties to be paid at the custom-houses.”
The inability of being <i>assignantes</i> was of considerable inconvenience
to English merchants, and obliged them to pay a <i>per centage</i> to a
Portugueze for the use of his name in this capacity. The <i>assignantes</i>
are bondsmen for the duties to be paid at the end of three
and six months; and no reason could be urged against Englishmen
being allowed to serve as <i>assignantes</i>, excepting that of leaving the
country without waiting to answer their bonds.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Article</span> 19th. “All goods, merchandises, and articles whatsoever
of the produce, manufacture, industry, or invention of the dominions
or subjects of either of the High Contracting Parties, shall be received
into the ports of the other, upon the terms of the most
favoured nation.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Article</span> 20th. “Certain articles of the growth and produce of Brazil,
which are subject to prohibitory duties in Great Britain, as they
are similar to the produce of the British colonies, are permitted to
be warehoused in Great Britain for exportation.” The non-admission
of these commodities, which are principally sugar and coffee, for the
consumption of the British empire, has been subject to discussion.
It was not to be expected that Great Britain would sacrifice her own
possessions by this alteration in her policy; and particularly towards
a country in which the articles in question can be produced at a
smaller expence than in the British colonies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[470]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Article</span> 21st. “British East Indian goods and West Indian produce
may be subjected to prohibitory duties in the dominions of
Portugal.” British merchants might complain of this article with as
much reason as the Portugueze do of the former. The relative
situations of the two empires require both of them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Article</span> 23d. “His R. H. the Prince Regent of Portugal being
desirous to place the system of commerce announced by the present
Treaty upon the most extensive basis, is pleased to take the opportunity
afforded by it, of publishing the determination pre-conceived in
His Royal Highness’ mind of rendering Goa a free port, and of permitting
the free toleration of all religious sects whatever in that city
and its dependencies.” Here is another most pleasant symptom of
change of policy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Article</span> 25th. “Great Britain gives up the right which she enjoyed
of creating factories or incorporated bodies of British merchants
in the Portugueze dominions.” This was a privilege of considerable
importance, from the union which it produced among the
merchants of that nation residing in the same place. They were
better able as a body to urge any petition to the Portugueze government,
and to transact the affairs which interested them generally.
However their protection is sufficiently provided for in other articles
of the Treaty, and therefore it is well that this privilege was given up:
it was an odious one, and not necessary; and certainly was not consistent
with the basis of reciprocity upon which the Treaty was
formed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Article</span> 26th. This declares that the stipulations existing concerning
the admission of the wines of Portugal into Great Britain,
and the woollen cloths of Great Britain into Portugal, shall remain
unaltered<a name="FNanchor_263_263" id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a>. The article continues thus; “in the same manner it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[471]</a></span>
is agreed, that the favours, privileges, and immunities, granted by
either contracting party to the subjects of the other, whether by
Treaty, Decree or <i>Alvará</i>, shall remain unaltered.<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a>”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Article</span> 32d. “It is agreed and stipulated by the High Contracting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[472]</a></span>
Parties, that the present Treaty shall be unlimited in point
of duration, that the obligations and conditions expressed or implied
in it shall be perpetual and immutable, and that they shall
not be changed or affected in any manner, in case H. R. H. the
Prince Regent of Portugal, his heirs or successors, should again
establish the seat of the Portugueze monarchy within the European
dominions of that crown.”</p>

<p>Brazil is thus laid open for ever. However, even if the government
was so inclined, it would be impossible to close the ports of
that kingdom to foreign trade; the benefits which have resulted
from the direct intercourse with Great Britain have been too generally
felt for the people to be made to return to the ancient colonial
system.</p>

<p>The British North American colonies first shewed the example of
throwing off the yoke of the mother country, and this was to be expected
from the principles of many of the first settlers. The attempt
succeeded, but a doubt still remains whether it would not have been
more to their advantage to have remained subject to Great Britain
for some time longer;&mdash;whether they were at the time of emancipation
of a competent age to rely upon their own resources. However
the spirit of their government and of their people, may have
made amends for any prematurity of freedom; and the United States
have advanced with most surprising (I may almost say unnatural)
rapidity, in power and wealth, and consequent importance in the scale
of nations. Their change of situation was not however obtained
without years of bloodshed and desolation.</p>

<p>The Spanish colonies are now making the same experiment; they are
experiencing great misery, and the contest is far from being decided.</p>

<p>Brazil has obtained a government of its own, under most peculiar
circumstances, and these have probably saved that country from the
misery of revolution. If the rulers of that extensive kingdom perform
their duty, if they act with common prudence, their own downfall
may be prevented, and the unhappiness of a whole people for the
space of one generation, may be rendered unnecessary. The government<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[473]</a></span>
has much to do before the people will or ought to be satisfied;
and the people have been too much accustomed to submission, to be
excited to a change of government, unless the grievances under which
they suffer are of such magnitude as to be too considerable to be
borne.</p>

<p>The reformation which would, I think, reconcile the people is not
of very difficult execution. Judicious taxation, instead of the system
which exists, is requisite in the first place; the articles of primary
necessity are heavily taxed, such as provisions of all descriptions, and
the same occurs with respect to the most important articles of trade.
An impartial administration of justice ought in the second place to be
provided for. The abolition of all monopolies, and of the system of
farming the taxes. A decrease in the power of civil and military
magistrates: a change in the manner of recruiting: a suppression of
great numbers of the civil and military officers of government,&mdash;by the
existence of these taxation is rendered much heavier than it otherwise
would be, fees are augmented, and the redress of grievances
becomes more difficult because responsibility is more divided. The
misconduct of each person is not of sufficient moment to be taken
notice of, and mal-practices are too widely diffused to be punished.</p>

<p>The change of policy which would lead to the general advancement
of the country, consists in the abolition of the slave trade,
in the toleration of all religions, in the naturalization of foreigners,
and perhaps ultimately in the establishment of legislative assemblies,
and of a general Cortes.</p>

<p>If my limits would allow, and this was a proper place for the purpose,
I think I could shew that the <i>reformation</i> which is proposed is
perfectly within the power of the Court, and is absolutely necessary
for the security of the present dynasty. The <i>change of policy</i> must
be entered into gradually. The government will not go so far at
present;&mdash;neither are the people fit for the reception of the whole of
these innovations, nor would they accord with their ideas. They are
steps to which all countries which are in a state of improvement must
advance; and if those persons who are placed at the head of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[474]</a></span>
affairs are aware of what is due to them revolutions may be prevented,
by keeping pace with the ideas of the people, and attending to their
progressive state.</p>

<p>I look forwards with hope to a continuance of peace in Brazil;
I trust that the devastations of revolution, that the misfortunes which
political convulsions produce may be averted; that the natural
quietude and goodness of the people of that kingdom, and the
wisdom and prudence of the government will unite in the far preferable
plan of continuing in the path which all those persons who
desire their welfare will pray for;&mdash;in conceding to each other, and in
agreeing to establish a lasting empire upon the true basis of perfect
confidence.</p>

<h2 class="p4">APPENDIX.</h2>

<p class="pline ">-</p>

<p class="drop-cap p2">I HAVE in a former part of this volume mentioned Dr. Manoel Arruda da
Camara, as having published two pamphlets at Rio de Janeiro, in 1810.
One of these is entitled “A Dissertation upon the Plants of Brazil from
which fibrous substances may be obtained, adapted to various uses in society,
and which may supply the place of hemp; the enquiry being made by
order of the Prince Regent.” The other pamphlet is called “An Essay on
the utility of establishing gardens in the principal provinces of Brazil for the
cultivation of new plants.”</p>

<p>I shall only give those parts of the works which may be interesting to
English readers.&mdash;<i>Transl.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[476]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Nat. Char.</i> No stem.</p>

<p>Leaves radical and few, (from 3 to 7) from three to six feet long, channelled,
revolute and spiny, green in the interior or concave surface, and
stained with transverse whitish marks on the exterior or convex surface.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Flowers</span>, The stalk two feet long, flexuose and almost spiral, with alternate
scales without thorns; the spike simple, the peduncle or flower stalk
short. Bracteæ small, the floral leaves simple, and at the foot of each flower
stalk. <span class="smcap">Calyx</span> monophyllous, with obtuse indentations, trifid, tubular, permanent
and erect. <span class="smcap">Corolla</span> tripetalous, tubular, of a bluish purple colour,
oblong, obtuse, erect, with nectariferous scales at the bases; from the middle
of each petal to the bottom is a channel which sheaths a single filament of the
stamina. <span class="smcap">Stamina</span> consist of six filaments inserted in the receptacle; of
these, three are alternate with, and three are opposite to the petals; of the
last the bases run down the grooves in the petals, and fix themselves in the
receptacle. <span class="smcap">Pistil</span> consists of one filiform style, with a single stigma.
<span class="smcap">Pericarp</span>, an oval, pointed berry, somewhat angular and umbellate, nearly of
the size of an olive.</p>

<p>The plant is to be found in the Sertoens of Pernambuco, Paraiba, Searà,
and principally in the Sertam of Cariri de Fora, and Pajaù, and upon the
banks of the river St. Francisco. It blossoms in the months of July, August,
and September.</p>

<h3 class="p2">USES.</h3>

<p>The leaves of this plant are composed of two segments, one exterior and
convex, and the other interior and concave; the former is more compact and
hard, the latter is thinner; between them is to be found a quantity of longitudinal
fibres, of the same length as the leaves, fixed in a juicy pulp. These
fibres are strong, and from them cordage may be made, and even coarse cloth,
if care is taken in preparing the thread. This may the more easily be done,
from the enormous quantities which nature affords without the aid of cultivation.
The inhabitants of the banks of the river St. Francisco weave their
fishing nets of these fibres.</p>

<p>There are two methods of obtaining the fibres of the <i>caroà</i>. 1st. Having
taken the leaf from the plant (which is easily done) the convex side of it
should be clipped at the bottom with a knife, and with the other hand, the
fibres pulled out, some force being necessary. They will bring with them a
quantity of vegetable liquid, with which the pulp is soaked. For this reason<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[477]</a></span>
the above manner of obtaining the thread is called <i>ensuar o caroà</i>, to sweat
the <i>caroà</i>. The fibre which is thus extracted is green, and it is necessary to
wash it, for the purpose of cleaning it. 2d. The leaves being taken from the
plant, and being tied up in bundles, should be thrown into water, where they
must be allowed to remain for four or five days; then they should be taken
out to be beaten in bunches, that the hammers or mallets may not cut the
fibres. This operation will not be sufficient to separate it from the pulp, but
it will be necessary to tie it up again in bundles, and to steep it for two days
or more, at the close of which the beating should be renewed; it must be yet
a third time put into water, and beat. After this the fibres are usually obtained
clean; and they should be wound up and braided that they may not
be entangled.</p>

<p>I have observed, that by beating the leaves, and thus bruising them before
they are in the first instance put into water, the labour is much diminished;
and that maceration in stagnant waters produces the desired effect in much
less time than in a cold running stream. If the fibres which are obtained by
each process above-mentioned, are examined, it will be found that those
which have undergone the first, are stronger than those of the second, but
more labour is necessary; the difference, however, will not be experienced
if the fibre is bruised before it is steeped, because this operation accelerates
the maceration. The fibre of this, like that of all other plants, is subject to
rot, if it is allowed to remain under water for any considerable time.</p>

<p>The expence of obtaining the thread which is extracted by the first process,
cannot be calculated with exactitude, because it entirely depends upon the
expertness of the persons who perform the work; and this again depends
upon habit and practice. I have purchased it at 1200 <i>reis per arroba</i> of 32
<i>lbs.</i> or at 2½<i>d. per lb.</i> The fibre which is obtained by the second process, is
sold at a cheaper rate, because the labour is less; I have purchased this at
1000 <i>reis per arroba</i>, rather more than 2<i>d. per lb.</i></p>

<p>It is not necessary to cultivate the plant; many leagues of land are covered
with it; and there are situations which are so completely overspread with it,
that the ground cannot be passed over. This occurs in many parts of
Curimataû, and of Cariri de Fora; both these places are in the captaincy
of Paraiba. It is in these that I recommend the establishment of manufactories,
for the purpose of extracting the fibre, for they are the nearest to
the coast, and there are good roads to them by which the produce may be
carried in carts and waggons. Although the <i>caroà</i> is long lived, still many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[478]</a></span>
leagues of the lands which were covered with it have been laid waste by the
fires which mischievous persons, sportsmen, and even the owners of estates
annually let loose (<i>such is Arruda’s expression</i>). It is probable that even
the remaining <i>caroà</i> grounds will be destroyed, if government does not take
some measures to prevent a continuance of such practices, fulminating
penalties against the incendiaries of so useful a plant.<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Crauata de Rede</span>, Bromelia Sagenaria:&mdash;<i>Arrud. Cent. Plant. Pern.</i> The

<p>Leaves radical and many, (from 3 to 9 feet long) one inch and a half wide,
channelled; the edges ciliate spiny, ash-coloured on the convex, and green on
the concave surface.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Flowers</span>, The stalk, a foot and a half long, with alternate leaves, the
flowers of a bluish purple colour, with the receptacles united. <span class="smcap">Calyx</span> monophyllous,
with obtuse indentations, trifid, erect. <span class="smcap">Corolla</span> tripetalous,
tubular, erect, obtuse, blue, each petal has at the base nectariferous scales.
<span class="smcap">Stamina</span> consist of six filiform filaments, three alternate and three opposite,
fixed to the receptacle; and of oblong, bilocular anthers. <span class="smcap">Pistil</span> consists of
one filiform style with a single stigma. <span class="smcap">Pericarp</span>, a trilocular berry, united
by the sides to the other berries, which altogether form one pyramidal fruit,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[479]</a></span>
covered, having long imbricate bracteæ. The seeds are of the size of a
grain of maize, fasciated.</p>

<p>The plant is to be found upon the coast of Pernambuco, Paraiba, and Rio
Grande, it does not extend into the interior more than ten or twelve leagues.
It is commonly called <i>crauatà de rede</i>, or net <i>crauatà</i>, because the inhabitants
of the parts in which it grows, make their fishing nets of its fibres. It
blossoms in July and August.</p>

<p>This species of <i>bromelia</i> is new; the fruit of it is similar to that of the
<i>bromelia ananas</i>, being however smaller; the berries are less juicy, and of a
disagreeable taste; the bracteæ are three inches in length, erect, and placed
one over the other after the manner of tiles, so as to cover all the superficies
of the fruit. I took its specific name of <i>Sagenaria</i>, from the circumstance of
its fibres being used by fishermen for making their nets.</p>

<p>The fibre of the plant varies in length from three to eight feet, according
to the greater or less fertility of the land; in dry land it is short, fine, and
soft; in good land, it is longer but likewise thicker and rough; the strength
of it is great, the following fact proving that this is the case. Upon the
wharf of the city of Paraiba, there is a rope made of this fibre, which has
been in use during many years, for the purpose of embarking the bales (<i>of
manufactured goods, I suppose</i>) and chests of sugar: with the same rope the
anchors of a line of battle ship were embarked, which had been left at
Paraiba by the (<i>charrua</i>) ship Aguia; they were intended for Bahia, and
could not be raised by hempen cables of greater diameter.</p>

<p>It is with difficulty that this kind of fibre becomes white by the common
manner of bleaching, which proceeds from a certain natural varnish (if I may
be allowed so to call it) with which the surface is covered; it does not rot
so easily as other kinds of fibre, when soaked in water. From this property
the fishermen prefer it for their nets; but notwithstanding the natural varnish
of its coloured parts, the fishermen increase its power to resist the water, by
carbonising (if I may be allowed so to say) the threads of their nets with
astringents which they obtain from various plants; such as the bark of the
<i>aroeira</i> and of the <i>coipuna</i>, and for this purpose the nets are steeped for some
time in a decoction or infusion of these barks, as is practised in tanning.</p>

<p>From the qualities which it possesses, and which I have just mentioned, I
am persuaded that the fibre is well adapted to the manufacture of cables, and
cordage; and the specimens of cloth, and one pair of stockings which
by this opportunity I forward to the ministry, made of it, indicate the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[480]</a></span>
possibility of manufacturing sail-cloth from it, and even finer cloths, if improvements
were made in its preparation; but these are at present entirely
disregarded.</p>

<p>The leaf of the plant is composed of two ligneous plates, one convex and
the other concave; and also of a quantity of longitudinal fibres inserted
between them, and united to each other by juicy fecula, but sufficiently attached
to prevent them from being disengaged by the hand; therefore they
can only be extracted by maceration. The plant is rooted up, which is done
by means of a forked stick, and is called <i>desbancar</i>. The leaves must then
be taken from the stem, and thirdly the thorns must be taken off, which is
done easily by separating the spiny edges with a knife. The leaves being
thus prepared are steeped in water for about a fortnight. The maceration is
known to be complete when the outward rind and ligneous bark of the leaves
are sufficiently soft to be pierced by the nail; the leaves are then taken out
of the water one by one, and the base of each of them is opened until the
fibres appear; the rind of each surface must be secured with one hand, that
with the other the fibres may be pulled out; even so they will be removed
with other substances attached to them. For the purpose of being cleaned,
they must be braided and again steeped for one day, and then beaten with
mallets upon a bench, and the maceration and beating must be repeated until
the fibres become clean. I have paid for each <i>arroba</i> of it 1920 <i>reis</i>, or 4<i>d.
per lb.</i> But the usual price at which it is sold is from 120 to 160 <i>reis</i>, or 8<i>d.</i>
to 10½<i>d. per lb.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Class</span>, Hexandria:&mdash;<span class="smcap">Order</span>, Monogynia:&mdash;<span class="smcap">Division</span>, Flowers complete.</p>

<p>The use which is made of the <i>ananas</i> at our tables is so common that in
this respect it is unnecessary that any thing should be said; therefore I shall
only mention the purposes to which the fibrous property of its leaves may be
applied. This I discovered in 1801, when I was directed by a Royal Order
to make enquiry into the fibrous qualities of indigenous plants. I found, on
comparing the fibre of this with that of all others, that it is the strongest
and the finest, and that it is adapted to the manufacture of cloth even of
superior quality. I took the leaves of two of these plants which weighed 14 <i>lbs.</i>
I beat them with mallets, washing those portions which had been beat; they
yielded rather more than one quarter of a pound of thread. The operation
lasted nine hours, being performed by one man. It is bleached with great
ease. The <i>ananas</i> may be produced in almost all kinds of land; it will grow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[481]</a></span>
in a sandy soil, and still more does it flourish in that which is argillaceous;
the sun does not destroy it, nor is it injured by rain; no insect attacks it.
Each shoot multiplies so largely, that in a short time the space which has been
at first left between each plant, is soon filled up. After a bed of <i>ananas</i>
has once been planted, very little care is required to keep it in order. I have
known some which have existed sixteen years without requiring to be replanted.
An excellent beverage may be obtained from it by fermentation.<a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ananas de Agulha</span>, Bromelia muricata:&mdash;<i>Arrud. Cent. Plant.</i></p>

<p>I have given the description of this plant in my first centuria; and do not
describe it in this place because I have not made any experiments with it, but
I suspect that it possesses fibrous qualities. Its fruit is of the same make as
that of the <i>ananas manso</i> and of the <i>crauata de rede</i>, from which it principally
differs, in having, instead of bracteæ, thorns of three inches and a half in
length, raised in the direction of the fruit, so that being covered with these
sharp thorns, it cannot be taken hold of without much care; from this peculiarity
it is that I took the specific name of the species.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Caroata</span>, Bromelia Karatas:&mdash;<i>Lin.</i></p>

<p>The little importance which the fibre of this species can claim, renders it
unnecessary for me to give a minute description of it. The leaves are from
8 to 10 feet long, and afford a great quantity of fibre, but it is not strong, and
can only be applied to very ordinary purposes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Caroata-açu, ou Piteira</span>, Agave vivipara:&mdash;<i>Lin. Syst. Veg.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[482]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Class</span>, Hexandria:&mdash;<span class="smcap">Order</span>, Monogynia.</p>

<p>The only uses to which at the present time this plant is put, are the following.
Its spungy pith possesses the property of burning gently without extinguishing;
the peasants therefore are in the habit of putting some of it
into their fires when they wish to prevent them from going out for a considerable
time. Hedges are made of it, by planting the bulbs or tender
shoots; these easily take root and grow. Piso says, “<i>ex foliis hujus plantæ
optimus pannus conficitur, qui si rite præparetur, panno lineo excedit; folia stupam
quoque et filosam materiam suppeditant, ex qua fila et retia sua contexunt
piscatores</i>.” From hence it may be inferred that the Dutch knew better than
we do how to take advantage of the natural productions of the country. At
the present time even the fishermen do not make use of its fibre for their
lines and nets, substituting in place of it the <i>crauata de rede</i>. The only use
to which the Portugueze apply the fibre of the <i>agave</i>, is in making the cords,
which the friars of the Third Order of St. Francis, commonly called of Jesus,
wear round their waists.</p>

<p>The fibre is to be obtained by maceration, but the leaves must in the first
instance be bruised, and afterwards steeped.<a name="FNanchor_267_267" id="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Coqueiro</span>, Cocos Nucifera&mdash;<i>Lin. Syst. Veget.</i></p>

<p>The oil which is obtained from the pulp of the fruit is easily separated from
the mucilage by means of fire; thirty-two cocos rendered me 17 <i>lbs.</i> of oily
pulp, and these gave me three pounds of pure oil. It is fitted to other purposes
besides that of food, for it serves to give light; and mixed with soda<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[483]</a></span>
it yields good soap, white and hard. One hundred cocos give one <i>canada</i> of
oil of the <i>canadas</i> of Pernambuco. So that each coco costing 10 <i>reis</i>, a
<i>canada</i> may be obtained for 1280 <i>reis</i>, or 7<i>s.</i> 1¼<i>d.</i></p>

<p>From the fibre of the outward rind of the coco, which is called <i>cairo</i>, may
be made all kinds of cordage; even cables are manufactured from it.</p>

<p>The only means by which the fibre of the coco rind can be obtained, are
by beating and maceration; before the rind is put into water to steep, it
ought to be beaten for the purpose of loosening its texture, principally that
of the outward surface, which is hard and compact; and this should be done
that the water may penetrate with more ease. After the first operation, it
must be left to steep for two or three days, and then should be beaten; and
this should be continued until the separation is accomplished; great care, however,
should be taken that the rind of the coco be not allowed to dry.
Because I have observed, that if this occurs, the ligneous fecula or spongy
pulp, which is found intermixed with the fibres, adheres still more strongly
to them. I have likewise remarked, that from the rind which has been recently
taken from the coco, the fibre is much more easily extracted than from
that which has been along time separated from it.<a name="FNanchor_268_268" id="FNanchor_268_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a></p>

<p>The rind of 40 cocos rendered me 6<i>lbs.</i> of <i>cairo</i>. The annual produce of
the coco groves of Itamaraca is 360,000 cocos, more or less; and according
to calculation these are capable of yielding 1680 arrobas of prepared <i>cairo</i>.
The island of Itamaraca is three leagues in length, and the coast is alone
planted with coco trees, and if these are thus productive what might not the
coco groves yield, which extend along the coast from the river St. Francisco
to the bar of Mamanguape, a distance of 94 leagues all cultivated with coco
trees?<a name="FNanchor_269_269" id="FNanchor_269_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a></p>

flowers, and in the middle the male.</p>

<p><i>Spec. Char.</i> Stem arboraceous, leaves sagittate, about one foot long, petioles

<p><i>Nat. Char.</i> Stem from 6 to 8 feet long, two to three inches in diameter,

leaves; the substance spongy, juicy, soft; and in this substance are numerous
longitudinal fibres, of the thickness of the hairs of horses’ tails, long.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Branches</span> are uncommon.</p>

<p>Leaves are rather more than one foot long and of the same breadth at the
base, sagittate, simple, coriaceous. <span class="smcap">Petioles</span>, amplexicaul, two feet long,

of 23 inches, the remainder is cylindrical.</p>

spadix is almost one foot long. <span class="smcap">Stamina</span> numerous. <span class="smcap">Pericarp</span>, many berries
at the base of the spadix.</p>

<p>The plant is to be found in Pernambuco, and it grows so plentifully in
marshes that many are covered with it.</p>

<p>The substance of the stem of the plant is spongy, and full of an acid juice
which acts upon metals; some of the peasants use this in cleaning their knives,
firelocks, &amp;c. This is the only use to which the plant has, as yet, been applied;
but from the experiments which I have made upon it, I am persuaded
that it may be rendered serviceable in the manufacture of cordage of great
strength.</p>

<p>As the fibres are placed in the pulp longitudinally, and are slightly fixed to
it, the operations of beating and washing will separate them entirely. I have
not made any experiments as to the durability of the cordage.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tucum.</span> This is the name which is given to a species of palm tree, but I
have not yet been able to acquaint myself with what genus it belongs to.
Piso speaks of it, giving a bad print of it and a worse description. Manoel
Ferreira da Camara in his <i>Descrip. fisica da Comarca dos Ilheos</i>, exaggerates
the utility of the fibre of the plant. I tried to obtain the fibre from the leaves
in a dry state, or, as the peasants term it, <i>suado</i> (sweated.) I held with the
left hand the point of the leaf, and with the right rather lower down, I
doubled it as if I was going to break it, at the same time pulling it. After
it was broken, there remained in my left hand some fibres, which had been
loosened from the inner surface of the leaf. I soon saw that this would not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[485]</a></span>
do, for one person would not be able to extract more than one eighth of a
<i>lb.</i> of fibre in the course of the day; therefore I had recourse to maceration,
but this did not succeed, for at the close of eight days I found that both the
leaves and the fibre had rotted. Other species of palms grow in great numbers,
forming groves of many leagues, such as the <i>Carnâùba</i>, the <i>palmeira</i>,
properly so called, the <i>uricuri</i>, and the <i>catolé</i>, &amp;c. but the <i>tucum</i> and another
kind called <i>Maiarà</i> grow in the shade of the woods, where they are much
scattered, each tree being at some distance from the other; the <i>tucum</i> has few
leaves; it is a thin palm tree of 5 to 6 inches in diameter and of 12 to 16 feet
in length.</p>

of the corolla. <span class="smcap">Corolla</span>, tripetalous, oblong, concave, pointed, yellowish.
<span class="smcap">Stamina</span> consist of six filiform filaments of the length of the corolla and of
incumbent anthers, oblong. <span class="smcap">Pistil</span>, style thick, without a stigma, barren.
<span class="smcap">Female Flowers.</span> Calyx small, whitish, monophyllous, trifid, irregular, permanent.
<span class="smcap">Corolla</span> tripetalous, rounded, the sides imbricate and united in
the middle with the nectary. <span class="smcap">Nectary</span>, a monophyllous corolla which lines
and reunites within the bases of the petals. <span class="smcap">Stamina</span>, none. <span class="smcap">Pistil</span> consists
of a rounded germen, a very short style and three stigmata, simple. <span class="smcap">Pericarp</span>,
a round drupe, of the size of a large <i>jambo</i> or rose apple, or of a small common
apple, yellowish: it consists of a ligneous exterior bark which is weak;
of a bony nut, an oily almond, and a layer of oily, yellow pulp.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[486]</a></span></p>

<p>The plant is to be found in Pernambuco, and in some other parts of
Brazil.</p>

<p>The oily pulp of the fruit and the almond of the inner stone is eaten, and
is sold in the markets. The ventricose or middle part of the stem contains
a fecula which is extracted in times of want, and is eaten being prepared
in various manners. The leaf contains a fibre fine and strong, like the leaf
of the <i>tucum</i>; but like that it is difficult to obtain when dry or <i>suado</i>, and
impossible to get it by maceration, for the same happened with this as with
the <i>tucum</i> in the experiments which I made. This is a new species, and
owing to the middle of the stem being much thicker than the extremities, I
have given to it the specific name of <i>cocos ventricosa</i>. For some time I was
in doubt whether I should place it in this genus or not, on account of its
monopetalous nectary, which lines and unites the petals of the corolla within.
The female as well as the male flowers are fixed in cups hollowed in the
spike or common peduncle. The female flowers are solitary, that is, each in
its cup; the male flowers are two and two.<a name="FNanchor_271_271" id="FNanchor_271_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a></p>

<p>These are the fibrous plants of Brazil which are of the most importance.
It is evident that of all that have been mentioned there are only four which can
be made use of advantageously for cordage. The <i>caroa</i> (<i>bromelia variegata</i>);
the <i>crauatà de rede</i>, (<i>bromelia sagenaria</i>); the <i>caroata-açu</i> (<i>agave vivipara</i>);
and the fibre of the rind of the <i>coco da praia</i> (<i>cocos nucifera</i>); their cheapness,
the ease with which they may be prepared, their abundance, and the possibility
of obtaining them still cheaper, render these the fibres of chief importance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[487]</a></span>
The fibre of the leaf of the <i>tucum</i>, which has been so much extolled, and
that of the <i>macaiba</i>, and of the <i>dendezeiro</i> (another palm) cannot become of
general service to society, and much less can they be rendered applicable to
the use of shipping, from the difficulty with which they are to be obtained,
and from many other circumstances.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Class</span>, Monadelphia:&mdash;<span class="smcap">Order</span>, Polyandria.</p>

<p>The bark of this plant is with ease separated by means of maceration for a
fortnight; and from it cords are made for many purposes, and although they
are not very strong, they are much esteemed for slinging hammocks; when
the operation of macerating is made in clean water, the fibre becomes pretty
well whitened. The plant is not cultivated; and in the neighbourhood of
Paratibi it grows spontaneously, in such quantities that the inhabitants of
that village gather it for sale. I have heard that it grows in abundance at
Rio de Janeiro, and is known there by the name of <i>guaxuma</i>. The name of
<i>carrapixo</i> is likewise given in Pernambuco to some other plants, of which the
seeds stick to whatever chances to touch them, by means of small ears which
are thorny; for this reason the plant of which we are treating is sometimes
called <i>carrapixinho</i>, for the purpose of distinguishing it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Guaxuma do Mangue</span>, Hibiscus Pernambucensis:&mdash;<i>Arrud. Cent. Plant.
Pern.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Class</span>, Monadelphia:&mdash;<span class="smcap">Order</span>, Polyandria.</p>

<p><i>Gen. Char.</i> Calyx double, the outside divided into many segments, the
inside into five segments, campanulate. Capsule quinque-locular; many
seeds.</p>

<p><i>Spec. Char.</i> Leaves cordate, entire; stem fruit-bearing, with the exterior
calyx monophyllous, having eight notches.</p>

<p><i>Nat. Char.</i> Stem of six feet and more; bark black, few branches.</p>

<p>Leaves cordate, rounded, acuminated, entire; the petioles cylindrical.
Stipules deciduous, acute.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Flowers</span>, Large, yellow, like those of the cotton plant, axillary and terminal;
each peduncle of one, two, and three flowers. <span class="smcap">Calyx</span> double, permanent,
the exterior monophyllous, with eight notches, acute; the interior
monophyllous, campanulate, divided into five segments, acute and long.
<span class="smcap">Corolla</span> pentapetalous, yellow, and the petals hold the stameniferous column<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[488]</a></span>
upon their bases. <span class="smcap">Stamina</span> numerous, fixed to the stameniferous column by
subulate filaments; anthers rounded. <span class="smcap">Pistil</span> consists of one oval germen
acuminate; one style, which is longer than the column of the stamina, erect,
and it has four or five separate stigmata. <span class="smcap">Pericarp</span> a capsule of almost one
inch long, pentangular and quinque-locular, inclosed in the calyx, which is
much enlarged after fecundation.</p>

<p>The plant is to be found in Pernambuco in places near to the sea, or where
salt water reaches, and principally upon the banks of the rivers Goiana and
Paraiba. I have found it in flower and fruit in the months of February and
March.</p>

<p>The persons who catch crabs tie them to each other with the bark of the
plant; and this is the only use to which it is applied. Cordage might be
made of its inner rind, as is practised in some parts of America with the
<i>hibiscus populneus</i>; also the <i>hibiscus tiliaceus</i>, from which at Cayenne cords
for common use are made.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Embira Branca</span> or <span class="smcap">Jangadeira</span>, Apeiba Cimbalaria:&mdash;<i>Arrud. Cent. Plant.
Pern.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Class</span>, Poliandria:&mdash;<span class="smcap">Order</span>, Monogynia.</p>

<p><i>Gen. Char.</i> Calyx, monophyllous, trifid; pericarp a decem-locular capsule,
covered with thorns or spines, depressed, opening only on the lower side.</p>

<p><i>Spec. Char.</i> Stem of 20 to 30 feet long, and of one foot and a half in
diameter.</p>

<p>Leaves ovate, lanceolate, cordate, reticulate, green and smooth above,
covered with hairs, which are of a copper colour underneath. <span class="smcap">Stamina</span>
monadelphic. The plant is to be found in Pernambuco, abounding in the
virgin woods. It blossoms from August to October.</p>

<p>The timber of this tree is not compact, and its specific gravity is much
less than that of water, with which it does not easily become saturated. The
inhabitants of the coast make use of it for the purpose of constructing rafts;
three or four of these trees are put together, and are well fastened to each
other<a name="FNanchor_272_272" id="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a>. The bark of the tree is fibrous, and from it a great quantity of
cordage is made for the common purposes of the country.</p>

<p>Marcgraff calls it <i>Apeiba</i>; and Aublet adopted the same name when he
fixed the genus of the three species which he describes in Guiana, and he
supposes that the species <i>tibourbu</i> is the same as that which Marcgraff speaks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[489]</a></span>
of in Pernambuco; they are certainly alike, but I imagine that it must be a
variety, from the size of the tree, which only grows there to the height of
eight feet, and here it exceeds 20 feet. There is less hair upon the leaves,
the silky work of the edges is not so deep; and there is even some difference
in the shape; the stamina are manifestly monadelphic. This last circumstance
inclined me to call it <i>apeiba monadelpha</i>, but the use to which the tree
is applied in the construction of rafts decided me in calling it <i>cimbalaria</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Embira Vermelha</span>, Unona carminativa:&mdash;<i>Arrud. Cent. Plant. Pern.</i></p>

<p>This plant has a red fibrous bark, of which as much use is made in manufacturing
cordage as of the <i>embira branca</i>; but the bark ought not be permitted
to be gathered, for the tree produces seeds, of which the capsules have
the taste and the pungency of black pepper. Many persons make use of
them as a spice in cooking, and some even prefer them to pepper; they are carminative.
If the bark is taken off, the tree dies; the seeds are worthy of
becoming an article of trade as a spice.<a name="FNanchor_273_273" id="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a></p>

<p>I have omitted a great number of plants which possess fibrous properties,
that this Dissertation might not be made too long; some of them are not
much in use, and others are not applied to any purpose. I shall mention
some, such as the <i>guaxuma branca da mata</i> (<i>helicteras baruensis</i>) of which the
inner bark is white and strong, but on being wetted, it becomes rotten and
breaks. However, I think it might be applied to the manufacture of paper.
The <i>barriguda or sumàûma</i> (<i>bombax ventricosa:&mdash;Arrud. Cent. Plant. Pern.</i>)
and the Sertam plant, called the <i>embiratanha</i>, which I have named <i>bombax
mediterranea</i>, also afford fibre from the bark, but they are not much used.
All the species <i>anona</i> (called commonly <i>areticum</i>) afford fibre, and of these
the plant which gives the strongest and the most durable fibre is the <i>areticum
a pé</i>. The cord with which the flag of Fort Cabedello at Paraiba is
hoisted, is made of the rind of this plant, and it has been there for many
years. Finally all the plants of the genera <i>hibiscus</i>, <i>sidas</i>, <i>altheas</i>, and in
general all the mallows afford fibre of greater or less strength. The <i>embiriba</i>
(<i>lecythis</i>) gives tow, and although it cannot be applied to the manufacture of
cordage, its use is great for caulkers.</p>

<p class="pc1"><i>An Essay on the Utility of establishing Gardens in the principal Provinces of
Brazil.</i></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="smcap">The</span> first part of this pamphlet treats of the advantages which Brazil would
obtain by the establishment of Royal Botanic Gardens. The second part
contains a list of those plants which it would be expedient to transplant from
other quarters of the globe to Brazil, and from one part of Brazil to the other.
I shall only translate that portion of the second part which relates to the
plants of Brazil.&mdash;<i>Transl.</i></p>

<p class="pc1"><i>Plants of Parà and Maranham.</i></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="smcap">Cravo do Maranham</span>, Myrtus caryophylata.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pixuri.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abacati.</span>, Laurus Persea:&mdash;The fruit of this tree contains a butterous
substance, which is very pleasant; there are two kinds or varieties, one of
which is distinguished by the name of Cayenne.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bacuri</span>, Moronobea esculenta:&mdash;This tree grows to a great height; and
the stem is entirely without branches, forming at the top a large cope. The
fruit is nearly of the size of an orange, but it is oval and contains 23 stones
covered with a white pulp, which have a pleasant taste, being sweet, and
somewhat acid. In Pernambuco is to be found another species of the same
genus, growing in marshes, which is commonly called <i>gulandim</i>; on cutting
into the stem a white juice oozes out, which appears to me to be resinous, and
perhaps might be applied to some use. Both these species are described in
my Centuria of the new genera and species of the plants of Pernambuco.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bacaba</span>, Areca Bacaba:&mdash;<i>Arrud. Cent. Plant. Pern.</i> This palm tree is a
species of <i>areca oleracea</i>, producing however larger fruit; the nut is covered
with a mucilaginous pulp, from which the inhabitants of the places in which
it grows make an excellent beverage, called <i>bacabada</i> or <i>ticuara de bacabas</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abacaxi</span>, Bromelia:&mdash;There are three varieties of <i>ananas</i> at Maranham,
called <i>abacaxi</i>; of one the fruit is white, and the leaves are not serrated; of
another the fruit is of a purple colour, and the leaves spiny; the third I
have not seen. I brought the two first varieties to Pernambuco, where they
have been planted, and are already becoming common, and they have been
forwarded by some patriotic persons to other provinces. Their flavour is
much superior to that of the species which has been long well known.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Maracuja Mamam</span>, Passiflora Alata.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[491]</a></span></p>


<p><i>Plants of Seara.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Piqui</span>, Acantacaryx Pinguis:&mdash;<i>Arrud. Cent. Plant. Pern.</i> This plant produces
most abundantly a fruit of the size of an orange, of which the pulp is
oily, feculous, and very nourishing. It is the delight of the inhabitants of
Searà and Piauhi. The tree grows to the height of fifty feet, and is of proportionate
thickness. The timber of it is of as good quality as that of
the <i>cicopira</i>, for ship-building. It grows well in the sandy plains which are in
Pernambuco called <i>taboleiros</i>, and in Piauhi <i>chapadas</i>, therefore its cultivation
would be very advantageous in the <i>taboleiros</i> bordering the coast, which
are at present of no service. It has afforded great assistance to the people in
times of drought and famine.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Buriti</span>, An Borassus?&mdash;This species of palm is one of the highest and
most beautiful of trees; it grows only in bogs and marshes; the fruit is of
the size of a hen’s egg, and of the same form; it is of a red colour at the
time of maturation, and is covered with scales spirally arranged. Under the
scales is found a layer of oily pulp of the same red colour, from which the
inhabitants of Piauhi obtain an emulsion; when this is mixed with sugar, it
becomes a substantial drink, which is by no means unpleasant. However, if
it is used to excess, the colour of the fruit is communicated to the surface of
the skin, and to the white of the eyes, producing the appearance of jaundice,
but without any injury to the health.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Maracuja Suspiro</span>, Passiflora:&mdash;This is the finest flavoured fruit of the
genus; it is called <i>suspiro</i>, because one of them may be swallowed at once,
leaving upon the palate a most exquisite taste and a sweet smell. It is to be
found in the Serra de Beruoca, upon the borders of Acaracù.<a name="FNanchor_274_274" id="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mandapuca</span>, Myrtus Scabra:&mdash;<i>Arrud. Cent. Plant. Pern.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Coco Naia</span>, a large palm tree, which is to be found abundantly in Cariri
Novo and Piauhi; the nut contains three or four seeds, from which oil is extracted,
and this is applied to the same purposes as that of the <i>cocos nucifera</i>.
The nut is covered with a feculous substantial flour, which has afforded much
relief in times of need. From this fecula is made a soup or <i>angù</i>, as it is
called, which is seasoned with the emulsion or oil obtained from the almond<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[492]</a></span>
of the same fruit. The pith of the tops of these palms is a white substance,
tender, juicy, sweetish, and pleasant to the taste, and it is harmless even if
eaten raw. If it be boiled with meat, the taste is not unlike the cabbage, but
it is more solid. After having taken from it the saccharine parts by means
of one boiling, it becomes capable of being seasoned, and many excellent
dishes are made from them, after the manner of the <i>areca oleracea</i>. For the
knowledge of these last uses the inhabitants of those parts are indebted to
my example. The same may be practised with the <i>palmeira pindoba</i> (<i>cocos
butiroza</i>, <i>Lin.</i>) which is very common at Pernambuco. For these purposes
the larger trees should not be cut down, but rather only those which have
attained the height of ten or fifteen feet.<a name="FNanchor_275_275" id="FNanchor_275_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marangaba</span>, Psidium Pigmeum:&mdash;<i>Arrud. Cent. Plant. Pern.</i></p>

<p>This is a species of <i>goiaba</i> plant which does not attain more than two or
three feet in height; it abounds in the <i>chapada</i> of the Serra Araripe of
Cariri Novo.<a name="FNanchor_276_276" id="FNanchor_276_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a></p>

<p>In front of my house at Itamaraca, there was a <i>dendezeiro</i> which stood alone, and I know that
there was no other tree of the same species anywhere within sight. The tree bore fruit.&mdash;<i>Transl.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[493]</a></span></p>

<p class="pc1"><i>Plants of Pernambuco.</i></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="smcap">Carapitaia</span>, Carlotea formosissima:&mdash;<i>Arrud. Cent. Plant. Pern.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bilros</span>, Carlotea Speciosa:&mdash;<i>Arrud. Cent. Plant. Pern.</i></p>

<p>Two beautiful species of a new genus, which I have dedicated to H. R. H.
the Princess of Brazil; the roots of these plants are tuberous, abounding with
soft and nutritive fecula, which has afforded assistance to the people of the
Sertam of Pajaù in times of drought. These plants are worthy of being cultivated
not only from their utility but for the purpose of ornamenting
gardens, their flowers being umbellate, crimson, and very beautiful.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Canella do Mato</span>, Linharia aromatica:&mdash;<i>Arrud. Cent. Plant. Pern.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Catinga Branca</span>, Linharea tinctoria:&mdash;<i>Arrud. Cent. Plant. Pern.</i></p>

<p>Of the first of these plants the leaves and bark have a pleasant smell, which
is like that of cloves. It is not as yet used, being unknown. I have made
use of the leaves and bark of this plant in distilling rum, and have obtained a
pleasant liqueur. I have learnt by experience that the extract of the leaves
is not only pleasant to the taste and smell, but that it likewise strengthens the
stomach. It is to be found in the greatest abundance upon the <i>taboleiros</i>,
which bound the captaincies of Paraiba and Searà, upon the borders of Pinhancò,
and I have likewise seen it in Piauhi.<a name="FNanchor_277_277" id="FNanchor_277_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a></p>

<p>The second of these plants is a shrub which grows abundantly upon the
skirts of the mountains, and upon the banks of the rivulets of the Sertoens of
Pernambuco, Paraiba, and Seara. It yields by boiling a yellow dye, which
is sufficiently durable upon skins. It is probable that some means might be
found of fixing the colour upon cotton cloth, as is the case with the <i>tatajuba</i>
(<i>morus tinctoria</i>). Besides this use, it is applied to that of curing <i>sarnas</i>, an
eruptive complaint; the patient being washed in a decoction of the leaves.
As I could not arrange these plants in any of the known genera, I have
formed one for them to which I have given the name of <i>Linharea</i>, in memory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[494]</a></span>
of D. Rodrigo de Souza Coutinho, <i>Conde de</i> Linhares, the cultivator
and protector of letters.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carnauba</span> or <span class="smcap">Carnaiba</span>, Corypha cerifera:&mdash;<i>Arrud. Cent. Plant. Pern.</i>
This palm is one of the most useful plants of the Sertoens; it rises to the
height of thirty feet and more; the <i>varzeas</i> or low lands upon the borders
of the rivers and rivulets of Pernambuco, Paraiba do Norte, Searà, and Piauhi,
and principally the banks of the rivers Jaguaribe, Apodi, Mossorò, and
Açu, are covered with these trees. When the fruit of it has attained the size
of a small olive (which when green it resembles in form), it should be boiled
several times in different water to take off its astringent properties; and then
a sufficient boiling being given it becomes soft and has the taste of boiled
maize. In this state it is eaten with milk, and is a wholesome food. The
pith of the stem of the young plants, being bruised in water, affords a nutritive
fecula, as white as that of mandioc. The plant should not much exceed
the height of a man when used for this purpose. It is of great service to the
inhabitants of those parts in times of drought and famine. The leaves of the
young plant are of two feet in length, and are doubled after the manner of a
fan, whilst they are yet young; afterwards they open, and become of little
less than two feet in breadth. If they are cut in this state, and are allowed to
dry in the shade, a considerable quantity of small light coloured scales will
be loosened from the surface. These will melt by the heat of a fire into
white wax, of which it possesses the properties; it is however more brittle,
but this may be remedied by mixing it with the common wax, which is more
oily. In 1797 I made known this discovery to the R. P. M. Fr. Joze Marianno
da Conceiçam Vellozo, who published the account of it in the <i>Paladio
Portuguez</i>; but at that time I was not so well aware as I am now of the importance
of the wax.</p>

<p>The fruit of this tree when ripe is black and shining, and of the size of
eggs of tame pigeons. The kernel is covered with a layer of sweet pulp,
which is eaten by cattle, as are also the dry leaves which fall, when other
food fails. The leaves are used for covering houses, and although thus exposed
to the weather, they last for twenty years without requiring to be renewed.
The stem is made use of for building houses, for fences, pens, &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_278_278" id="FNanchor_278_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[495]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anil de Pernambuco</span>, Koanophyllon tinctoria:&mdash;<i>Arrud. Cent. Plant. Pern.</i></p>

<p>This is a shrub which grows to the height of twelve feet or more. It is of
the class syngenesia; the leaves are from two to three inches in length, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[496]</a></span>
of proportionate breadth; it is enough to soak a piece of cotton cloth in its
juice for it to become green, and from this colour it is changed to blue by
the absorption of the oxigen of atmospheric air. The colour becomes so
fixed, that it resists the action of soap and the lye of potash, and it rather
brightens than fades after it has undergone these experiments. It is probable
that by fermentation and beating, it may yield blue fecula, like the
common indigo (<i>indigofera tinctoria</i>). I know that it may be cultivated with
ease, for I have sown the seeds which are like those of the lettuce; they
come up in a few days. The land which is adapted to it is <i>varzea fresca</i>, or
marshy land composed of <i>maçape</i>, or stiff clay.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anil trepador</span>, Cissus tinctorius:&mdash;<i>Arrud. Cent. Plant. Pern.</i></p>

<p>If the leaves of this plant are rubbed upon a white cloth, they impart to it
a green colour like that of any other herb. By exposure to atmospheric air
it changes this colour for a fixed blue, which resists the lye of potash and
soap. It is found in the mountains and low lands of the Sertoens.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Herva Lombrigueira or Arapabaca</span>, Spigelia anthelmia:&mdash;<i>Lin. Syst.
Veget.</i></p>

<p>This plant has anthelminthic properties, and is sold in our towns. It grows
abundantly in argillaceous low lands.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Urucu</span>, Bixa Orellana. <i>Lin.</i></p>

<p>This is a shrub, and is worthy of cultivation from the dye which the leaves
afford; but it is not cultivated by any one in Pernambuco, not even as a
curiosity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pitombeira</span>, Meleagrinex Pernambucana:&mdash;<i>Arrud. Cent. Plant. Pern.</i></p>

<p>This tree grows to the height of 30 or 40 feet; the timber of it is compact
and may be applied to some purposes. It produces its fruit in large rounded
bunches, in capsules which do not open. It has a solid kernel of two cotyledons,
covered with a sweetish acid pulp, which is not unpleasant. If turkeys
eat of these kernels they die immediately; from this circumstance I took the
name of the genus, of which I have only found two species.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Imbuzeiro</span>, Spondia tuberosa:&mdash;<i>Arrud. Cent. Plant. Pern.</i></p>

<p>This is a tree which grows plentifully in the Sertoens of Pernambuco and
Paraiba. It produces a fruit which is rather smaller than pullets eggs,
obovate, with five points at the lower part, being the indications of the five
stigmata. Its colour is yellow, and below the coriaceous epidermis, it
retains a juicy pulp, of a pleasant sweetish acid taste. With this juice, and
milk, curds, and sugar, a much esteemed mess is made, called <i>imbuzada</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">[497]</a></span>
This tree throws out long horizontal roots, which penetrate very little, and
upon these are seen at short distances round tubers of eight inches (<i>hum palmo</i>)
in diameter, full of water, like unto water-melons; these supply the vegetation
of the tree in seasons of drought, and sometimes refresh the sportsman
who has penetrated into the woods. The re-production of the tree is
very easy by means of shoots.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Piranga</span>, Bignonia tinctoria:&mdash;<i>Arrud. Cent. Plant. Pern.</i></p>

<p>This is a fruit-bearing and sarmentose plant; its leaves yield, by boiling, a
red dye, which can be made a fixed dye upon cotton cloth, by means of preparations
analogous to those which are made for madder.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Umari</span>, Geoffroya spinosa:&mdash;<i>Jacq. Stirp. Americ.</i></p>

<p>This plant, which Jacquim found at Carthagena in the sandy lands near to
the coast, grows at Pernambuco upon argillaceous low lands, upon which it
arrives at 30 or 40 feet in height; in Carthagena, according to the same
author, it does not reach more than twelve feet. The flowers are yellow,
and have a smell which is similar to that of the coco-oil; those of Carthagena
have a disagreeable smell. May they not be two separate species?
From the almond of this plant is extracted a white and nutritive fecula, of
which the inhabitants of the Rio do Peixe, and of the Sertam of Paraiba do
Norte make much use. The plant grows very plentifully in the low lands of
those parts, and it is also to be met with in the province of Rio Grande do
Norte.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ipecacuanha preta</span>, Ipecacuanha officinalis:&mdash;<i>Arrud. Cent. Plant. Pern.</i></p>

<p>Until the present time the botanists of Europe have not known to what genus
this plant belongs. Some of them thought it was the <i>euphorbia Ipecacuanha</i>,
others, that it was the <i>psoralia glandulosa</i>, others, the <i>spiræa trifoliata</i>, others the
<i>viola ipecacuanha</i>, finally others suspected that it was the <i>psychotria emetica</i>; but
I have observed the <i>ipecacuanha preta</i> very frequently when in flower, and I think
that it has more affinity to the <i>tapagomea</i> of Aublet. However, I have given it
the name of <i>ipecacuanha</i>, for although both are barbarous, still the latter has been
used for a century and a half. The Ipecacuanha is easily cultivated, for I
have made the experiment, but it requires shade, or at any rate it must not
be completely exposed to the heat of the sun.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ipecacuanha branca</span>, Viola Ipecacuanha:&mdash;<i>Lin.</i> Pombalia Ipecacuanha:
<i>Vandel</i>.</p>

<p>Although the root of this plant was formerly mistaken for that of the
<i>ipecacuanha preta</i>, it is well known now to be of another description. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[498]</a></span>
much used in medicine in Pernambuco, as a gentle purgative, &amp;c. It is
easily cultivated, and delights in a moist atmosphere and a sandy soil.
In the neighbourhood of the Campina Grande (of Paraiba) I have seen
large pieces of ground covered with the plant. Of this species of ipecacuanha
our druggists might make their syrup of <i>viola</i>, and our physicians
might without scruple apply the flowers and calyx in place of the flowers of
the <i>viola odorata</i>, for it promotes expectoration, and possesses stimulant qualities
which strengthen the nerves.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Contra-herva</span>, Dorstenia rotundifolia:&mdash;<i>Arrud. Cent. Plant. Pern.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Contra-herva de folha longana</span>, Dorstenia Pernambucana:&mdash;<i>Arrud.
Cent. Plant. Pern.</i></p>

<p>These two species of <i>contra-herva</i> are new, and are peculiar to Pernambuco;
besides these two I have not met with any other species. But they
have the same virtue as the true <i>contra-herva</i> of Mexico (<i>dorstenia contra-herva</i>),
and the physicians of Pernambuco do not use any other. They are
to be found in great quantities in some parts.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Angelim</span>, Skolemora Pernambucensis:&mdash;<i>Arrud. Cent. Plant. Pern.</i></p>

<p>The fruit of this tree possesses the strongest vegetable anthelminthic properties
with which I am acquainted. It is necessary to be careful in the use
of it, for if the dose is too large, the medicine will attack the nervous system,
and produce convulsions. The common dose is one-fourth part of a seed for
an adult. I know of three species of this plant.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Batata de purga</span>, Convolvulus mechoacan.</p>

<p>The root of this species of <i>convolvulus</i> is tuberose; and a dose of two
drachms of the fecula is sufficient as a purgative. The root is cut into small
slices that it may be dried with more ease; a thread is then passed through
the middle of each slice, for the purpose of exposing them for sale. It is a
gentle purgative, and is now much in use, therefore it is worthy of being cultivated.
It may be observed as being remarkable, that quantities of the
root are sometimes sold by the peasants which have little effect. This ought
to be attributed to its being gathered out of season. All plants should be
gathered after their maturation. Thus the <i>batata de purga</i> should be
gathered after the fruit and leaves have dried, but before the rains come on.
I have observed in Pernambuco two species of <i>convolvulus</i>, of tuberose roots,
both of which are purgative, and the prepared root of both is commonly
known under the name of <i>purga de batata</i>; one of these is the true <i>convolvulus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[499]</a></span>
mechoacan</i>, and is different from the other in leaf, branch, and fruit; of this I
have given the description in my Centuria of new plants.<a name="FNanchor_279_279" id="FNanchor_279_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Papo de Peru</span>, Aristolochia grandiflora:&mdash;<i>Arrud. Cent. Plant. Pern.</i></p>

<p>This beautiful species of <i>aristolochia</i>, which I first met with in the torrents of
Cariri Novo, is medicinal, and is worthy of being cultivated in gardens, not
only for its utility, but likewise on account of the beauty and size of its
flower. Besides this, I am acquainted with five species of <i>aristolochia</i>, some
of which may be made useful. The plant is commonly called <i>angelicò</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mangabeira</span>, Ribeirea sorbilis. This tree grows well in the sandy lands of
the <i>taboleiros</i>; the fruit varies from the size of a pigeon’s egg to that of a
pullet’s; the colour is a greenish yellow, spotted with red; it is almost of the
consistence of the service; and is well known in the markets of Pernambuco
and Bahia. Considerable numbers of these trees are now cultivated in the
neighbourhood of Olinda; and the attention which is paid to the tree has
improved the fruit. If this is pounded spirituous fermentation takes place
with great ease, and from this passes to acetosity; thus the juice forms most
excellent vinegar, in a very short period, which I found to be stronger than
that of the grape, of the sugar cane, of bananas or of <i>cambuins</i>. I have
described this new genus in my <i>Cent. Plant. Pern.</i> dedicating it to my disciple
P. Joam Ribeiro Pessoa de Mello Montenegro, professor of drawing in
the seminary of Olinda. He is worthy of this honour, not only from having
attempted to introduce into this captaincy the cultivation of some useful exotic
plants, but from the curious and philosophical examination which he
has made respecting the wonderful phenomenon of the manner of the fructification
of the <i>mangabeira</i> plant, which will be found in my <i>Centuria Plant.
Pern.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oiti Coroia</span>, Pleragina rufa:&mdash;<i>Arrud. Cent. Plant. Pern.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oiti da Praia</span>, Pleragina odorata:&mdash;<i>Arrud. Cent. Plant. Pern.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oiticica or Catingueira</span>, Pleragina umbrosissima.</p>

<p>The first species of this genus (<i>oiti coroia</i>) produces an irregular drupe, of
which the kernel is covered with a sweet fecula, somewhat aromatic, pleasant,
nutritive. It is large enough to satisfy one person. It is sold in the
markets, and by some individuals it is now cultivated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[500]</a></span></p>

<p>The second species (<i>oiti da praia</i>) produces an oval or oblong drupe, very
little smaller than a hen’s egg; it is yellow at the period of maturation; the
kernel is covered with a sweet, aromatic, and nutritive pulp.</p>

<p>The third species (<i>oiticica</i>) is peculiar to the Sertoens, where it grows upon
the borders of rivers and rivulets. It rises to the height of 50 or 60 feet;
its branches are so diffuse, and double so much, that they nearly reach the
ground, forming a spacious cope. The fruit is an oblong drupe of two inches
or more in length, and of half an inch in thickness; it always retains its
green colour, even when ripe. The kernel is not hard like the kernels of the
two preceding species, but it is ligneous and flexible, and can easily be broken;
it is covered with a layer of astringent pulp. The almond is a seed
composed of two oily cotyledons of a disagreeable taste, but abounding with
an oil, of which some use is now made.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gendiroba</span> or <span class="smcap">Andiroba</span>, Feuillea cordifolia;&mdash;<i>Lin.</i></p>

<p>This is of the natural order of cucurbitaceous plants; the seeds are very
oily, and from them oil is easily extracted, which, as well as that of the <i>cocos
nucifera</i>, has the property of coagulating. I have made good soap from it
even with potash, depriving it of carbonic acid by means of virgin lime.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Caroba</span>, Kordelestris symphilitica;&mdash;<i>Arrud. Cent. Plant. Pern.</i> Bignonia
copaia; <i>Aublet. Guien.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Caroba miuda, or casco de cavallo</span>, Kordelestris undulata;&mdash;<i>Arrud.
Cent. Plant. Pern.</i></p>

<p>These two species possess antivenereal properties, and are particularly
serviceable against the infection which is called <i>bobas</i>, yaws.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Barbatimam</span>, Mimosa virginalis;&mdash;<i>Arrud. Cent. Plant. Pern.</i></p>

<p>This tree is not very large; its bark is one of the strongest astringents,
and is at the same time somewhat stimulating, which renders it applicable
to some disorders. The peasants use it to heal their own wounds, as well as
those of animals. Women use it after child-bearing, bathing themselves in a
decoction of the leaves. I am persuaded that the extract of it, if it did not
exceed would at least equal in medicinal virtue the <i>mimoza catechu</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Almecega</span>, Amyris Pernambucensis;&mdash;<i>Arrud. Cent. Plant. Pern.</i></p>

<p>This is a tree which sometimes attains a great height; from its bark oozes
a resinous juice which is indissoluble in water, but it is completely dissolvible
in spirit of wine. The woods of Goiana and of Alhandra abound with these
trees, and the Indians of the latter place gather the gum in considerable
quantities, and sell it at from 20 to 40 <i>reis per lb.</i> It has almost the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[501]</a></span>
medicinal virtues as turpentine; when applied in the form of a plaister to the
forehead, it affords relief, and it usually removes the tooth-ach. Our apothecaries
use it in making up some kinds of ointments. It is mixed by our people
with the yellow wax of the country for the purpose of making candles
for common use. A fourth part of tallow is added to it, for caulking canoes,
water wheels of sugar mills, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The gum is known under two forms; that which is white and clean is called
<i>almecega cozida</i> or boiled; for the Indians who gather it, boil it for the purpose
of separating the impurities, and they make loaves of it of 16 and 20 <i>lbs.</i> weight.
The <i>almecega crua</i>, or raw, when dissolved in spirits of wine, might be used
in the composition of some kinds of varnish; and being burnt, it might serve
instead of incense, as is practised with the balsam of the Sertam, and as the
resin of the <i>amyris ambrosiaca</i> or <i>icica heptafylla</i> of Aublet is used in some
parts of America.</p>

I have made use of this spelling, from the word cocoa being applied in the English

A Portugueze gentleman once observed to me, that in France and other countries
many clever men had written and spoken strongly, and for a considerable length of time
against this way of life, and that they at last even effected their purpose with much difficulty;

and no speaking is necessary to bring them into disrepute.</p>

When the Englishmen, who first established themselves at Recife, had finished the
stock of tea which they had brought with them, they enquired where more could be purchased,
and were directed to an apothecary’s shop. They went, and asked simply for tea,
when the man wished to know what kind of tea they meant; he at last understood them,
and said, “O, you want East-Indian tea,” “<i>Cha da India</i>,”&mdash;thus considering it as he
would any other drug. But at the time of which I am now speaking, great quantities are
consumed.</p>

I once heard, that a person who had been in England, and had returned to Pernambuco,
observed, that the two things which surprised him the most in that country, were,
that the people did not die, and that the children spoke English. He was asked his reason

A <i>Juiz Conservador</i>, Judge Conservator, of the British nation has been appointed for
Pernambuco, but at the period of my departure from Recife, he was not arrived. Very
soon after the commencement of a direct commercial intercourse with Great Britain, a
vice-consul was appointed for Pernambuco, by the consul-general at Rio de Janeiro; this
person was superseded by a consul sent out direct from England, who is subject to the
consul-general of Brazil, but the place is disposed of by the government at home.</p>

When Brazil was in its infancy, the clergy could not subsist upon their tythes, and
therefore petitioned the government of Portugal to pay them a certain stipend, and
receive the tenths for its own account; this was accepted, but now that the tenths have increased
in value twenty-fold, the government still pays to the vicars the same stipends. The
clergy of the present day, bitterly complain of the agreement made by those to whom they
have succeeded.</p>

A great confusion exists in Brazil respecting measures. Every captaincy has its
own, agreeing neither with those of its neighbours, nor with the measures of Portugal,
though the same names are used invariably: thus a <i>canada</i> and an <i>alqueire</i> in Pernambuco
represent a much greater quantity than the same denominations in Portugal, and
less than in some of the other provinces of Brazil.</p>

An old woman applied at the gates of a convent, late one evening, and told the porter,
an old friar, who was quite blind, that she wished one of the brothers to go with her,
for the purpose of confessing a sick person. The old man, with perfect unconcern, gave
her to understand, that they were all out, adding, “but if you will go to the garden gate,
and wait there, some of them will soon be creeping in.”</p>

The younger members of the Franciscan order enjoy very much the duty of going out
to beg, as opportunities offer of amusing themselves. A guardian was chosen at Paraiba
some years ago, who examined the chest in which the money belonging to the community
was kept, and on finding a considerable sum in it, gave orders that no one should go out
to beg. He was a conscientious man, and said, that as they had already enough, the
people must not be importuned for more, until what they possessed was finished. He kept
the whole community within the walls of the convent for the term of two or three years,
for which each guardian is appointed. On another occasion, the friars of a Franciscan
convent chose for their guardian a young man, whose life had been very irregularly spent
in any thing rather than the duties of his calling, under the idea, that during the continuance
of his guardianship, they would lead a merry life,&mdash;that very little attention would
be paid to the rules and regulations of the Order; but they were mistaken, he changed his
habits as soon as he found himself at their head; the gates were rigidly closed at the
proper hour, and according to the old and vulgar proverb, of “Set a thief,” &amp;c. the
duties of the convent were performed with much greater austerity than before.</p>

An anecdote was related to me of one of these couples, which occurred some years
ago, under a former Governor. A solitary passenger, between Olinda and Recife, witnessed
part of the following scene, and the remainder was described by one of the actors
in it. A couple of criminals, of which one was a white man, and the other a negro,
accompanied by their guard, were walking over the sands, to reach a ford, and cross the
river at its narrowest part. Three horsemen, one of whom led a fourth horse, saddled and
bridled, rode up, and one of them knocked the soldier down, whilst the white man of the
chained couple urged his companion to go with him to the led horse, and mount up behind
him: this the black man refused to do, when one of the horsemen, who seemed to direct
the others, called out, “Cut the fellow’s leg off.” The criminals are secured to each other
by the ankle. The negro now agreed, and both mounted the horse, and the whole party
galloped away, first binding the soldier hand and foot. They passed through Olinda at
full speed, and when they had arrived at some distance, a large file was made use of, and the
negro was set down with all the chains and bolts. The party then proceeded, and were
never afterwards heard of. It was imagined, that the man who made his escape in this
manner, was the relation of a rich person in the interior, who had either committed
some crime, or had been thus unjustly punished.</p>

Lately, a cadet has come forwards, and has taken the direction of these matters; he
has apprehended several persons of infamous character, but of determined courage; he
has done much good, risking his life under circumstances of great danger, and even
to extreme rashness has he been carried by his zeal. This young man well deserves promotion.
That thus the police should fall into the hands of inferior officers, shows the
irregular footing upon which it stands.&mdash;1814.</p>

I had frequent opportunities afterwards of resting at this inn; on one of these,
I happened to ask for salt, which is not usually placed upon the table; the master of the
house, in the customary familiar manner of the country, expressed his surprise, at the
additional quantity of salt which I wished for, but it was brought to me, and nothing further
was said. This occurred in the morning, soon after our arrival at the place; at dinner,
to our dismay, the soup and almost all the other dishes were so plentifully supplied
with the unfortunate ingredient, as to be scarcely eatable. We complained of this to the
master, who answered, “Why, I thought you liked salt.” “<i>Cuidei que eram amigos

Between two and three years after this journey, I heard again of my friend the
Major. I became acquainted with a man who resided at the foot of the Serra do Teixeira,
which is beyond the estates of the major’s father. The old colonel was killed by a bull before
his own door. The animal had been driven into a small inclosure, and became mad from
feeling himself confined. It was necessary to bring him to the ground, which is done in a
peculiar manner, by running a short iron prong into a certain part of the thigh. The
herdsmen were afraid, and wished to let the beast have time to cool and become less
violent; the old man, who was between seventy and eighty years of age, told them, that if
they were afraid, he would attack him, and immediately entered the inclosure; but before
he could prepare to receive the bull, and was still leaning against the palings, the animal
ran at him, and fixed his horns through the old man’s body, with sufficient force to run
them into the palings, and in such a manner that before he could extricate himself, one of
the herdsmen ran a long knife into his head between the horns, and brought him to the
ground; but the old man lost his life.</p>

Another member of this family was also to be apprehended, but the governor could
not fix upon any means by which the arrest was to be accomplished. A man of well-known
intrepidity and of some power was sent for by the governor, to consult with him
upon the subject. This person offered to go alone, and acquaint the Feitoza with the
orders that had been issued against him, and in fact to try to take him into custody. He
set off, but Feitoza was apprized of his coming and of his errand, and, immediately leaving
his estate, proceeded to Bahia, where he embarked for Lisbon, arriving in due time at
that place. The person who set off to arrest him followed him from place to place,
arrived at Bahia, and embarked for and landed at Lisbon. He enquired for Feitoza,
heard that he had spoken to the secretary of state, and had again embarked on his return
homewards, but that the ship was delayed by contrary winds. <i>He</i> likewise went to the
secretary, and shewed the orders which he had received for the arrest of Feitoza, making
known the particular crimes which had made his apprehension requisite. Feitoza was
taken into custody and put into the Limoeiro prison, where his persecutor or prosecutor
went to visit him, saying as he approached,&mdash;“Well, did not I say so,”&mdash;“<i>Entam eu
que disse</i>,” alluding to his determination of apprehending him. He returned to Brazil and
gave an account of his mission to the governor, from whom he had received his orders.
This man was well known in the province of Searà, and the truth of the story is vouched for
by many respectable persons with whom I conversed. This Feitoza has not been heard of.</p>

become wild; and he adds, that this is still the case in the Sertoens of Piauhi. He published

Lieutenant-Colonel Joam da Silva Feijò, in a pamphlet published at Rio de

of the country bear wool which has all the marks of being of a superior quality; that it is
in general soft, shining, well curled, of a good length, and strong.” He again says, “That
the governor,” the same of whom I have spoken, “sent a small quantity of it to England,
which was much admired and esteemed.” I did not certainly remark particularly the
sheep of Searà, and his opinion must of course be taken in preference to mine, as this

getting hold of my coat on each side. They asked me if I was going again to travel, for if
I was, they said that they were unemployed, and would go with me. Their attack had so
much the appearance of being more in violence than in the gladness of old friendship, that
one or two of my acquaintance who chanced to pass at the time, stopped and enquired
what was the matter, supposing that I had got into some scrape. These fellows literally
held me fast, until I had answered all their questions. Their fidelity seems to militate

The information which is contained in this note I had from Captain Juan Roman
Trivino, of the Spanish ship St. Joze, of 300 tons burthen. He received orders to proceed
from Rio de Janeiro to Maranham, for the purpose of loading cotton, in the commencement
of the year 1815. He arrived off the settlement of Searà, and sent on shore
for a pilot to take him to St. Luiz; he was informed that none resided at Searà, but that
he would find one at Jeriquaqùara, a high hill between Searà and Parnaiba. On arriving
near to this place, he discovered an Indian in a canoe fishing, who came on board, and
offered to pilot him to St. Luiz. This was agreed to, and they proceeded; but from mistaking
the two points of land in the manner mentioned above, the Indian took the vessel
into the bay of St. Joze, on the 15th March. They kept the lead going, even before they
discovered the error into which they had been led, as is the custom with all vessels bound
to St. Luiz. The ship was brought to an anchor off the village of St. Joze, which is
situated upon the N.E. point of the island of Maranham, in eleven fathoms water. Whilst
they continued in the mid-channel of the bay, they found from eighteen to twenty fathoms.
The depth of water regularly decreases from the centre of the bay towards the land on each
side; but it contains no insulated sand banks. The ship was at anchor off the village of St.
Joze two days; they then proceeded through the channel, which is inclosed on either side
by mangroves, and is so narrow in some parts that the yards at times brushed against the
branches. The wind was fair, and they sailed through without being obliged to tow or
warp the ship. The depth of water varied from five to two and a half fathoms; the bottom
was of mud. About halfway through the channel, the tide from the bay of St. Joze and that
from the bay of St. Marcos meet. This takes place nearly but not quite opposite to the
mouth of the river Itapicuru. They were two days in sailing from the anchorage ground
at St. Joze to the island of Taua, which is situated near to the S. W. corner of the island
of Maranham. Here the ship came to an anchor in nine fathoms water, with a sandy
bottom; the captain sent to St. Luiz for another pilot, as the man who had brought
them thus far was not acquainted with the remainder of the navigation. The island of
Taua is rocky, and uninhabited, and is covered with palm trees. The village of St. Joze
appeared to Captain Trivino to be of considerable size, but, with the exception of two or
three, the houses were built of slight timber and of the leaves of different species of palm
trees. Its inhabitants were mostly fishermen. He mentioned that he saw a shoemaker at
work there. Captain Trivino understood from his pilot that the river Itapicuru is at its
mouth 120 yards wide, and that its depth is one fathom and a half.</p>

Joam IV. sent over one Bartholomew Barreiros de Ataide with three miners, one a
Venetian and the other two French, to search for gold and silver. After two years’ search
up the Amazons they returned to Maranham, and offered to supply the people with iron
at a <i>cruzado</i>, about 2s. 4d., <i>per quintal</i>, 128 lbs. weight, if the state would engage to take
all that they should produce at that price. The people were afraid to enter into any such
contract. The island was so rich in this ore that foreign cosmographers called it the <i>ilha
do ferro</i> in their maps, and all who came there with any knowledge of the subject said
that it was ore of the best quality. A thing of great importance to Portugal, which
bought all its iron, and yet this discovery was neglected.&mdash;From a Memoir of Manoel
Guedes Aranha, Procurador from Maranham, 1685, in the 6th Vol. Pinheiro Collection

from some differences existing among the directors of the Fabric.</p>

It is not perhaps generally known, that there are published in London three or four
Portugueze periodical works. One of them is prohibited in Brazil, and I have heard it
said, that all of them are so situated; but they are principally intended for Brazilian readers,
and they find their way all over the country, notwithstanding the prohibition. I have seen
them in the hands of civil, military, and ecclesiastical officers, and have heard them publicly
spoken of by them. It is said that the Regent reads them, and is occasionally pleased
with their invectives against some of the men in power.</p>

Before I came away in 1815, a considerable portion of the sand (which was covered
by the tide at high water) between St. Antonio and Boa Vista, had been raised, and houses
had been built upon it. The principal street of St. Antonio has been paved. The bridge
of Boa Vista has been rebuilt of timber; and that between St. Antonio and Recife was
about to undergo considerable repair. The hospitals, likewise, were to be improved; and
as I have heard since my arrival in England, of the appointment of a most worthy man
to the direction of one of them, I trust that this intention has been acted upon.</p>

Bolingbroke says, that instances are frequent of some of the European swine escaping
into the woods, where they live wild; and he adds, that their increase has been immense.
In another place he speaks of a species of this animal, which is peculiar to tropical
America, and is called the warree which he says is about the size of an European hog,
and much like it in shape. The <i>porco do mato</i> is not the <i>sus tajassu</i>, which is, I imagine,
what Bolingbroke calls the picaree hog.&mdash;Voyage to the Demerary, &amp;c. by Henry

These practices were, or rather are, at present, carried on in one part of the country
with which I am well acquainted. The persons who commit the crimes are white men
and of high birth. Among them was a priest. The magistrate of the district in question
was applied to by a man who had lost a cow, mentioning that he more than suspected
where she was, and at the same time naming the place. A <i>tropa</i>, a troop or party, of <i>ordenença</i>
soldiers was collected, and these men were dispatched to search the house, which had
been pointed out, under the command of a corporal of well-known courage. They arrived
there and knocked; the door was opened by the owner, who was the priest connected with
the gang; he said that he could not allow his house to be entered without an order from
the ecclesiastical court. This answer was conveyed to the magistrate who had signed the
order, the soldiers remaining round about the house. A second order arrived, and the
bearer brought with him a couple of hatchets, thus expressively pointing out to the corporal
what he was to do. Forthwith preparations were made for breaking open the
door, when the priest said, that he would allow the corporal to enter alone; the man fearlessly
went in, but as soon as the door was again closed the priest seized upon him, and
some of his negroes who were in another apartment sprang forwards to assist their master;
but the corporal disengaged himself, and standing upon the defensive called to his
men, who soon broke into the house. Search was made, and the carcase and hide of the
cow were found, and were with the negroes taken publicly to the nearest town. The mark
of the red hot iron upon the haunch had been burnt out of the hide, that discovery might
be rendered less easy. The priest was punished by suspension from saying mass for a
few months. I was subsequently acquainted with him; he was received by many persons
as if nothing had been amiss; but he was not received as heretofore, for the individuals of
his own profession would not, generally speaking, associate with him. The circumstance
had not however so completely prevented his re-entrance into decent society, as such a
crime would have done in many others countries, or so much as would have occurred at
Pernambuco, if he had been a layman.</p>

A free negro, with whom I had been acquainted whilst I resided at this place, and
who came to see me when I removed to Itamaraca, told me, with much horror pictured in his
countenance, of the fate of a man who had worked for me. He said that this person occasionally
became a <i>lobos homem</i>, a wolf man. I asked him to explain, when he said that the
man was at times transformed into an animal of the size of a calf, with the figure of a dog;
that he left his home at midnight in this metamorphosed state, and ran about with the violence
of a mad dog, and that he attacked any one whom he might chance to meet. The
black man was perfectly persuaded of the correctness of his own statement, when he related
having, with his brother-in-law and his sister, met this uncommon beast, near to their own
cottages. I suppose it was some large dog which prowled about to satisfy his hunger in
the neighbourhood of these habitations; but no, the man was persuaded that it was poor
Miguel.</p>

On Saturdays only, throughout the country, are cattle slaughtered; and thus weekly
many persons of each neighbourhood assemble, as much to converse and hear the news as
to purchase their portion of meat. On one of these occasions, a young man of colour was
stooping to arrange upon the end of his walking stick the meat which he had bought, at
the moment that a person of considerable power was riding up. The man of importance,
when he came near to the young mulatto, struck him with a long cane with which he rode,
saying “why don’t you take off your hat when a white man appears?” The blow was
felt severely, and still more severely answered. The man of colour drew his knife, and
quickly turning round, ran it hilt deep into the groin of him by whom he had been insulted;
and then with the bloody knife in his hand, he ran off, vowing destruction upon
any one who touched him. The rich man had only time before he died, to direct that the
murderer should not be pursued, owning that his own impetuous tyranny had deservedly
produced this catastrophe. The young man returned in a few weeks to his former home,
and was not molested by the relatives of him whom he had murdered, nor did the law take
cognizance of the deed.</p>

The following anecdote exemplifies the feudal state of the planters a few years ago.
It was related to me by a gentleman upon whose veracity I have every reason to rely.
Some fifteen years ago, the governor of Pernambuco sent for a sergeant of the only regiment
of the line which existed at that time, whose courage was well known and much
dreaded. He received orders from the governor to proceed with all expedition possible
to the sugar-plantation of Monjope, distant from Recife four leagues, for the purpose of
taking the owner of that place into custody; or if he found that his apprehension alive was
impracticable, he was then to bring his head to the governor. The sergeant was desired
to pick out as many soldiers as he thought fit to accompany him; but he said that he should
go alone, and consequently the following morning he set forth. On his arrival at
Monjope, he was received by the owner of the plantation, who was a colonel of militia, or
a <i>capitam-mor</i>. Being seated, he quietly made his errand known, shewing to the great
man the order for his apprehension, and mentioning the additional instructions in case of
disobedience. The colonel left the room, but soon returned with a bag containing about the
value of 100<i>l.</i> in gold coins, and presenting this to the sergeant, told him to return and tell the
governor that he would visit him as soon as possible, and explain to him the circumstances
which had given rise to this mission. The sergeant took the money, and set out on
his return; and by the way bought a sheep, killed it, and then cutting off its head, put this
into a bag. On arriving at the palace, he placed his bloody burthen upon the ground, and
pointing to it, said to the governor, “I have executed your commands; he would not come,
and therefore I have brought his head.” The governor, all amazement, answered, “and
have you really killed the colonel of Monjope?” The sergeant replied, “I have only
acted according to the orders which I received.” The following morning, what was the
astonishment of the governor, to hear that the colonel of Monjope was in waiting, and
wished to see him. He gave him an audience, matters were explained, and they parted
good friends. The sergeant was sent for after the departure of the colonel, and on being
questioned, told the whole story, and shewed the bag of money. The governor was displeased,
but at the same time ashamed of the rash orders which he had given. The sergeant
was however too useful a man to be in disgrace.</p>

I insert the following passage from No. 32d. of Dr. Thomson’s Annals of Philosophy,
p. 138. It is given for the purpose of acquainting the supporters of our Lady of the O,
that salt oozes from walls in an heretical, as well as in a Catholic country:</p>
<p class="pfc4">“The formation of nitre upon calcareous stones in certain situations has been long
known, and advantage has been taken of it to procure that important salt in great quantities;
though no satisfactory theory of the formation of the salt itself has yet been offered to
the public. The present paper contains a set of observations on the appearance of an
efflorescence of salt-petre on the walls of the Ashmole laboratory at Oxford, a large ground
room, sunk below the area of the street. The walls are built of Oxford lime-stone, a granular
floetz lime-stone, containing many fragments of shells, of vegetable bodies, and composed
of 96 carbonate of lime, and 4 of ochrey sand. The salt formed was nearly pure,
though it contained traces of lime and of sulphuric and muriatic acids. What was formed
in winter contained most lime. The formation of this salt was most rapid in frosty
weather; it formed slowly, and the quantity even diminished in moist weather after it had
been deposited. Exclusion from the air did not preclude the deposition of the salt, though
it diminished it considerably.” p. 70.&mdash;The paper, of which the above is an analysis, is by
John Kidd, M.D. professor of chemistry in Oxford.</p>

Some time ago a wooden figure was brought up out of the sea in a fisherman’s
net; it was deposited in a place of safety, and was on inspection, by some person who was
judged competent to decide upon the subject, declared to be an image of St. Luke; it was
removed to a church, and has taken its place as a representative of that saint. Now, I
have heard it whispered, that this said St. Luke is no more than the figure-head of some
unfortunate vessel which had been cast away, or that the figure had been broken off by a
violent wave.</p>

chiefs of the Cavalcante family; but as I was acquainted with him and several other persons
of the same description, I think the circumstance would have been mentioned, if this

At the distance of twenty leagues or more from Recife, there resided formerly the
Padre Pedro, upon the sugar plantation of Agua Azul, or the blue water. He had obtained
a grant from the Crown, of the surrounding lands, of one square league in extent,
and had fixed his dwelling upon a high hill, the summit of which was only to be reached
by a serpentine road which he had made with great labour. The sugar works were likewise
upon the hill, and the field around the eminence was inclosed by a deep and broad
ditch, and a thick hedge on the outside. The situation was remote, and the adjoining
country was in a very wild state; the woods were extensive, and almost impenetrable.
The disposition of the priest was as wild as the country in which he delighted to reside.
All deserters from the regiments of the line, and all persons who had committed crimes
in supporting the insulted honour of their families, in quarrels and provocations exciting
momentary violence of passion, were received by him; but he did not afford protection to
the thief. The fellows who were harboured by him inhabited the woods around the field,
and some of them had erected their huts upon the sides of the hill, thus forming a line of
communication; so that with a whistle or a conch, soon were assembled at his door forty
or fifty men, who were prepared to perform any service of whatever description he might
name; because they well knew that if they were bereft of his protection, his aid would be
given in the law’s support. To injure the priest or any of his satellites, was followed by
destruction to the offending person. He was, however, in the habit of sending many presents
to the chief persons in office, that no notice might be taken of his proceedings; for
although the government might not be able to destroy his feudal independence, still it
might have shaken his power. The priest was once sent for by a late governor of the province;
he obeyed, and brought with him a considerable number of his determined followers;
he dismounted, and ascended the steps of the palace, leaving directions to his people, who
remained below, that no person should be permitted to enter after him. The governor
complained to him of his avowed practice of harbouring deserters; to which the priest
replied, that he thought his Excellency was aware of the inutility of speaking to him upon
that subject; and having said this he immediately left the room, mounted his horse, and
proceeded homewards without molestation.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Another anecdote of this strange man was communicated to me by a person who had
witnessed the transaction. Two officers of justice or bailiffs, arrived at Agua Azul, and
served a writ for debt upon him; the priest received them with great calmness, but shortly
afterwards he ordered some of his people to take these two men and harness them in the
mill (which was then at work) in the places of two of the horses, (eight of these are employed
at the same time). He then ordered that the works should go on, and that a
negro boy should sit above and make these unfortunate fellows assist in its movement; there
they remained for some minutes, until half dead with fatigue and fear, he turned them
loose, and told them to relate to their employer the manner in which they had been
treated, threatening to do the same to him, if he could obtain possession of his person.
The priest had a considerable number of blood hounds, which were usually unchained,
and were lying about the house; thus rendering dangerous an approach to his dwelling.
The animals were well trained, for a call from their master was sufficient to make them lie
still, and allow of the advance of a stranger. This person died only a few years ago;
but as I have already elsewhere said, the time for such characters in Brazil is fast going by.</p>

A man of large property being much provoked at some outrage which had been committed
by one of these <i>Valentoens</i>, (who was a white man,) had said at his own home, that

shortly afterwards they met accidentally in one of the narrow-paths in the neighbourhood.
The <i>Valentam</i> was well-armed with musket, sword, and knife; he requested the
gentleman to stop, as he had something to say to him. The outlaw asked him for
a pinch of snuff, and then offered his own box, from which a pinch was in like
manner taken. He then mentioned the injurious words which had been repeated to him.
The unfortunate offender directly imagined what would follow, and therefore set spurs to
his horse, but the road was without any bend for some distance; the <i>Valentam</i> knelt down
upon one knee, and fired with the effect which he wished for. He quietly walked on
along the same road, telling the whole story of his meeting, at the first village through
which he passed. This man was at last taken, tried, and hanged at Bahia, through the
very great exertions of the brother of the person whom he had murdered. He could not
be executed at Pernambuco because he was a white man. The transaction occurred at
a short distance from Jaguaribe, about fifteen years ago.</p>

Labat speaks of a tree, of which the fruit is a perfect cure for the bite of the most
dangerous snakes. He says that it comes from the isthmus of Darien; that the buccaniers
were informed of its virtue by the Indians who accompanied them in their expeditions
across the isthmus. He does not give the name of the tree; but says “<i>sans nous embarasser
du nom de l’arbre nous nous contentons d’appeller son fruit noix de serpent</i>.” In his
time there were three of these trees at Martinique, which were of the size of apricot trees
in France. He says that he witnessed the success of the fruit. The account of the plant
and its virtues is too long to be inserted here. It is to be found in the <i>Nouveau Voyage aux
isles de l’Amerique</i>, tom. iii. p. 234 to 238.</p>
<p class="pfc4">In the same work, I find the following manner of cure from the bite of a snake, which
will not however be very generally adopted. “<i>Ceux qui ont assez de courage ou de charité
pour s’exposer a faire cette cure se gargarisent bien la bouche avec de l’eau-de-vie; et après
avoir scarifié la place, ils la succent de toute leur force, ils rejettent de tems en tems ce qu’ils
ont dans la bouche, et se la nettoyent et gargarisent à chaque fois, observant de presser fortement
avec les deux mains les environs de la partie blessée. On a vú de trés bons effets de cette cure,
mais elle est trés-dangereuse pour celui qui la fait; car s’il a la moindre ecorchûre dans la
bouche, ou qu’il avale tant soit peu de ce qu’il retire, il peut s’attendre à mourir en peu de momens,
sans que toute la medecine le puisse sauver.</i>” tom. i. p. 167.</p>

One of these Indians was selling crabs at Pasmado, when a purchaser began to pick
out those which he preferred; but the Indian stopped him, saying, “Don’t begin to pick
my crabs, for I belong to Amparo.” Thus even the crabs which were caught by the dependants

The dependants do not always shew the respect which, seemingly, they ought to

master, the owner of the place, in the field near to the dwelling-house. The Indian took
off his own hat to speak to his master, but the same was not done by his superior; however
the fellow quickly performed this for him, saying “When you speak to people take
off your hat.”&mdash;“<i>Quando se falla a gente tira se o chapeo.</i>” The master took this quietly
and when the conversation ended, his hat was returned.</p>

I do not know whether I might not almost say of Brazil: Regarding Itamaraca, there
exists the following adage, “What is it that persecutes thee island?” The answer is
“The being an island, the ants and Guedes.” “<i>Que te persegue ilha? Ilha, formiga, Guedes.</i>”
Or in other words, the inconvenience occasioned by being obliged to cross the channel from
the main land; the ants, which sufficiently explain for themselves; and Guedes;&mdash;these were
a family of unquiet spirits who resided in the island, and kept it in perpetual turbulence
from their quarrels. The remains still exist; but now they are good and peaceable subjects.</p>

A man of colour with whom I was acquainted possessed several tame oxen, some of
which with a cart he used to hire to the planters by the day, and one or other of his sons
attended to drive them. Two of these animals were stolen, and a suspicion falling upon
a man of reputed respectability in the country, who had rented a sugar plantation not
far distant, one of the sons of the owner of the oxen determined to try to ascertain the
fact. He dressed himself in leather, as a disguise, and rode to the dwelling of the person
in question, where he arrived at dusk. The master of the house was not at home, but
he spoke to the housekeeper, saying, that he had just arrived from the Sertam with
cattle on sale, which would reach the neighbourhood on the following morning; he requested
to know if she thought her master would purchase his drove. She answered in the
affirmative, but said that he had better stay all night, for the purpose of seeing the intended
purchaser, who would arrive on the next day. The false Sertanejo told her not
to be uneasy about his accommodation, as he would sleep in the mill, to which he rode,
and there he remained very quietly during the early part of the night. When all was
still he began to search for the hides or horns of his oxen. The former would be recognised
by the private mark, which was made (as is usual) with a red-hot iron upon the right haunch,
and the latter he would know from the peculiar bore of their tips (by which they are in
part harnessed to the cart) for he had bored them himself, and was in the constant habit
of driving these oxen; besides, tame oxen are so seldom killed, that if he found any horns
which were bored, he might presume that they were those of his beasts. He had given
up his search, and almost all hope of finding what he sought, when, as he lay in his hammock,
he happened to cast his eyes upwards, and saw two fresh out-stretched hides hanging
to the higher wood-work of the mill. He scrambled up the timbers with a lighted
piece of wood in one hand; and moving this to and fro near to the hides, that it might
give a better light, he discovered that they bore his father’s mark. He lost no
time in cutting from both of them the pieces which contained the mark, and carefully
preserving these he mounted his horse about two o’clock in the morning and rode home.
He kept the bits of leather as trophies, and shewed them in proof of his former assertions
respecting the person who had stolen the oxen, but neither did he obtain, nor did he expect
to obtain any redress. These transactions occurred in 1811, and within five leagues
of Recife.</p>

It has obtained the name of <i>formiga de roça</i>. The word <i>roça</i> means literally a piece
of land that has been planted, of which the native wood has been cut down and cleared
away. But at the present day, in Pernambuco, the word <i>roça</i> is applied to the mandioc
plant exclusively; thus a peasant will say “<i>hum bom roçado de roça</i>,” a good field of mandioc.
The word <i>roçado</i> is used in speaking of any kind of field; as for instance, a fine
<i>roçado</i> for cotton,&mdash;a fine <i>roçado</i> for cane, &amp;c.</p>

Labat says, “<i>Cet insecte engraisse les volailles</i>.” I know that fowls are fond of the
insect; but the peasants of Pernambuco prevent the poultry from eating it, because they
say that such food gives a bad taste to the flesh; this is, I think, by no means improbable,
for the <i>copim</i> has a most disagreeable smell. This author afterwards continues the
same subject, saying, “<i>Il y a deux sortes de bois qui ne sont pas de leur goût; l’acajou et le
bois amer. Cela vient de ce que le suc et le bois de ces deux arbres est extrémement amer</i>.”&mdash;Nouveau
Voyage, tom. ii. p. 389 and 392.</p>
<p class="pfc4">I do not know what tree he means by the <i>bois amer</i>, which in another place he calls <i>Simarouba</i>.

same occurs with regard to many other plants. The leaves of the acaju are certainly
extremely bitter.</p>

I have seen Piso’s account of the snakes of Brazil; and although the description which
I have given of those which I saw, and of which I heard, differs somewhat from his, I have
allowed mine to remain as it originally stood. Piso mentions the root of the <i>jurepeba</i> plant
as being efficacious in curing the bites of snakes. Is this the <i>jurubeba</i>? If so, it is surprising
that it should not now be used for this purpose. The <i>jurubeba</i> is to be found in
almost all situations; a small shrub which yields a fruit resembling the potatoe apple. A
decoction of the root is taken frequently at the present day for coughs and colds.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Piso likewise speaks of the <i>caatia</i>, or <i>caiatia</i>, or <i>caacica</i> plant, which he says, has deservedly
obtained the name of the <i>herva de cobras</i>; his description of it at p. 102, agrees in
some respects with that of the <i>herva cobreira</i>, of which I have spoken at chapter 12; but it
can scarcely be the same, for mine would have been more plentiful if it had been indigenous.</p>

Labat in his <i>Nouveau Voyage aux isles de l’Amerique</i> gives an elaborate account of
the mangrove plants. He speaks of three species, and treats in the first place of the <i>mangle
noir ou paletuvier</i>. To this tree he applies precisely what I should say of the <i>mangue vermelho</i>
or red mangrove, with respect to its manner of growing, and to the description of
the plant altogether, excepting in regard of the bark which he states in the <i>mangle noir</i>,
to be <i>fort brune</i>, whereas the red mangrove derives its name from the red colour of the
inside of the bark. He says that it is used for tanning, and “<i>on peut se servir du tronc de
cet arbre pour les ouvrages où l’on a besoin d’un bois qui résiste à l’eau</i>,” tom. ii. p. 195 and
197. I suppose he concluded that this would be so as the wood grew in the water.
Now the <i>mangues</i> with which I am acquainted soon rot, even in salt water when used as
stakes; for although the trees are propagated by means of shoots, if a part of the stem of
one of them is put into the ground it does not take root, and indeed soon rots in any situation.
The pens for catching fish are made of posts which are obtained from the forest, and
these are scarce and dear. Would not the mangrove be used, if it was sufficiently durable?</p>
<p class="pfc4">He speaks afterwards of the <i>mangle rouge</i>, and this from his description appears to me to
be what the Pernambucans call the <i>mangue bravo</i>; this does not grow in salt water, but in
the vicinity of it. It is a large tree of irregular make, the branches being much twisted
and full of knots.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Bolingbroke in his voyage to the Demerary describes the red mangrove as I have seen
it, but he says that the bark is grey. In the Third Report of the Directors of the African
Institution, p. 8, I find that some notion was entertained in 1809, of introducing the mangrove
bark into this country for tanning.</p>

The iron wood is mentioned by Bolingbroke in his voyage to the Demerary; and the
<i>bois de fer</i>, by Labat, in the <i>Voyage du Chevalier des Marchais à Cayenne</i>, &amp;c. he says, “<i>Le

I shall give the names of those with which I am acquainted: <i>parôba</i>, <i>jacaranduba</i>,
<i>guabiraba</i>, <i>araroba</i>, <i>cicopira</i>, <i>embiriba</i>, <i>sapucaia</i>, <i>aroeira do Sertam</i>. This last is only found
in parts far removed from the coast, and is accounted of equal value with the <i>pao ferro</i>.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Labat, in speaking of the kinds of wood which are fit for building, says, “<i>Je ne croi pas
devoir renvoyer à un autre endroit la remarque que j’ai faite sur tous les bois qu’on met en terre
qui est, que pour peu qu’ils soient bons ce n’est pas la partie qui est en terre qui se pourrit ni celle
qui est dehors, mais seulement ce qui est au ras de terre</i>.” This I have found to be true to a
certain extent; but there are some species of timber which rot very quickly under ground,
though the part which he terms <i>au ras de terre</i> is certainly that which decays the most
speedily. He continues “<i>Pour éviter cet inconvenient, il faut brûler la partie qui doit être en
terre et quelques pouces au dessus, c’est-à-dire la sécher au feu ou dans les cendres rouges, sans la
réduire en charbon, afin que la seve ou l’humidité qui s’y pourroit encore trouver, soit entierement
dessechée, que les pores se renfermant, les parties se raprochent les unes des autres, le bois
devient plus compact et par consequent plus propre à résister à l’humidité</i>.”&mdash;Nouveau Voyage,
tom ii. p. 386.</p>
<p class="pfc4">
This is done in Pernambuco, and is found to be of great service; but it is only practised
with those woods which are known not to be naturally durable under ground.</p>

Labat says, “<i>L’arbre que nous appellons acajou aux isles du Vent, est le même que celui
que les Espagnols appellent cedre dans la Terre-ferme et dans les grandes isles. Je ne sai qui
a plus de raison; car je n’ai jamais vû les cedres du Liban, que selon les rélations que j’en ai lû
ne ressemblent point du tout au cedre Espagnol</i>.” He says likewise, “<i>Ce qu’il ne faut pas confondre
avec l’acajou à fruit dont j’ai parlé dans un autre endroit</i>.”&mdash;Nouveau Voyage, tom. viii.
p. 208 and 212.</p>
<p class="pfc4">He speaks in vol. ii. p. 94, of two large Indian canoes made of <i>bois d’acajou</i> or <i>cedre</i>. I
am inclined to think that the <i>acajou</i> of the islands and the <i>cedre</i> of the Spaniards is the <i>pao
amarello</i> of Pernambuco.</p>

The indefatigable and all-observant, although unfeeling and brutal Labat, has also
mentioned the <i>pinham</i>, under the name of <i>medicinier ou pignons d’Inde</i>, and he gives a print
of it. His account of the plant is elaborate, and he speaks of three kinds. Of that of
which I have treated, he says, “<i>Sa fleur n’a rien de beau. Elle ne vient jamais seule,
mais en bouquets composez de plusieurs fleurons d’un blanc sale tirant sur le verd. Chaque
fleuron est composé de cinq feuilles en maniere d’etoile, qui font comme un cul de lampe arrondi
avec un col plus resserré et terminé par l’extrémité des feüilles qui se renversent en dehors. Le
fond du fleuron est garni et comme renfermé entre cinq petites feuilles. C’est du centre de ces
fleurs que l’on voit sortir le fruit; ordinairement il est de la grosseur d’une noix commune d’Europe.</i>”
He says again (after speaking of its purgative quality, which it likewise possesses
with that of provoking vomiting) alluding to the separation of each seed into two parts,
“<i>Lorsqu’elle est recente, elle se partage naturellement en deux parties, entre lesquelles on trouve
une petite pellicule à qui on attribüe une qualité de purger plus violemment qu’a tout le reste de
la noix</i>.” My old woman said, that the <i>pinham</i> should not be given, unless the person who
prepared it was well acquainted with it, because a certain part of the seed was dangerous;
but she would not shew me where the dangerous substance was to be found. Labat continues,
saying that four or five of the seeds are a proper dose as a purge, “<i>mais quand on
en prend une plus grande quantité, on s’expose à des vomissemens cruels et à des évacuations
trop grandes</i>.” He mentions a fact which is curious. In speaking of Europeans having
oftentimes eaten of this nut without being acquainted with its properties, he says, “<i>une régle
générale qu’il faut observer a l’egard des fruits qu’on ne connoît point est de n’y point toucher à
moins qu’on ne voye q’ils out été bequetez par les oiseaux</i>.”&mdash;<i>Nouveau Voyage</i>, tom. iii. p. 300,
301, and 302.</p>
<p class="pfc4">In Piso, p. 83, an account will be found of the <i>Munduy-guacu, Lusitanis Pinhoes do Brasil,
ejusque usu in medicina</i>.</p>
<p class="pfc4">I have perhaps quoted too copiously in writing an account of those plants which Labat
has described, but I must have followed so nearly what he has said, that my description might
have been supposed to have had his for its basis. Perhaps these plants need not have been
described at all, but to some readers a confirmation of what other travellers have said may
afford satisfaction.</p>

The following story was current at Conception, and I knew all the persons of whom it
was related. A young man was intimate in a family of a rank inferior to his own, and he
frequently made presents to several individuals of it, which was generally thought strange,
as it did not contain any young female. Therefore to account for this predilection, it was
reported, that the good old woman to whom he was so kind, possessed a small image of St.
Antonio, which was concealed in a bit of old cloth; and it had several scraps of ribbons
and I know not what else, tied to its neck, legs and arms; and with this she was said
to perform certain mysterious rites, which secured the continuance of the young man’s
affection towards herself and family.</p>

Labat, in the <i>Voyage du Chevalier des Marchais, a Cayenne, &amp;c.</i> vol. iii. p. 253, gives an
account of the bees which corresponds in some respects with mine. He says, “<i>Elles n’ont
point d’aiguillon, ou il est si foible qu’il ne peut entamer l’épiderme aussi sans préparation et
sans crainte on les prend a pleines mains sans en ressentir autre incommodité qu’un leger chatouillement</i>.”&mdash;I
do not think those of Pernambuco would be found to be quite so harmless.</p>

I have been much blamed by one of my friends for not having eaten of the flesh of the
<i>jacarè</i>; and indeed I felt a little ashamed of my squeamishness, when I was shown by the
same friend, a passage in a French writer, whose name I forget, in which he speaks favourably
of this flesh. However, if the advocate for experimental eating had seen an alligator
cut into slices, he would, I think, have turned from the sight as quickly as I did. The Indians
eat these creatures, but the negroes will not, no not even the <i>gabam</i> negroes who are
said to be cannibals.</p>

In making use of the word Brazil, it must be understood that I mean to denote that
portion of the country which I have had opportunities of seeing. The agriculture of the
provinces of Rio de Janeiro and Bahia is doubtless in a more forward state than that of
Pernambuco and the line of coast to Maranham.</p>

I insert here a description of a machine for rooting up the stumps of trees, by
Cit. Saint Victor, member of the Society of Agriculture, for the department of the Seine.</p>
<p class="pfc4">“It consists of a bar of forged iron, about two feet eight inches long, one inch thick
towards the handle, and of two inches towards the breech or platform. The platform,
which is circular, is fourteen inches in diameter. This platform serves as the base of the
chamber or furnace of the mine, which is three inches in diameter, and three inches eight
lines in the length of its bore. The stopper or tampion, which serves as a plug to the
mine, is of the same diameter, to enter within after a slight paper or wadding. It is attached
by a chain to the gun or mortar, which last is eight inches in diameter. About two
inches above is added a small touch-hole and pan. The hole is directed in an angle of
forty-five degrees, and is primed with powder to communicate with the charge with which
the chamber is filled up to the stopper. This engine may be cast even with more facility
in brass or bronze, and in this case it must be a little thicker in all its dimensions, in order
to afford a resistance equal to that of the forged iron.”</p>
<p class="pfcc p1">“USE OF THE MACHINE.”</p>
<p class="pfc4 p1">“When the machine is charged with powder, a small excavation is made with a pick-axe,
in the centre of the stump. The machine is then placed in it, so that the plug immediately
touches the wood. Care must be taken to fill all the vacancies, either with
stones or pieces of iron or wood, more especially beneath the platform of the machine, in
order that the explosion of the powder may have its full effect on the stump, of which, if
necessary, the principal roots should first be cut if any appear on the surface of the ground
near the stump that is to be eradicated.”</p>
<p class="pfc4">“When the machine is firmly fixed in its place, the priming is put into the pan, a slow
match applied, the length of which is sufficient to allow time to retire to a proper distance
from the explosion.”&mdash;Journal of Natural Philosophy, &amp;c. by W. Nicholson, vol. iv.
p. 243 to 245.</p>
<p class="pfc4">In Pernambuco the only means of rooting up the stumps which is known, is that of digging
deep trenches round about them.</p>

Labat says, that in clearing lands, it is not necessary to take up the stumps of the trees,
unless they are those <i>des bois mols dont les souches poussent des rejettons</i>; now in Brazil,
almost all the trees that have been cut down put forth shoots.</p>

Labat says, “<i>Les terres neuves grasses et fortes fournissent abondamment de la nourriture
aux souches, et les entretiennent pendant quinze et vingt ans et plus, sans qu’on s’apperçoive
d’aucune diminution, ni dans l’abondance, ni dans la bonté, ni dans la grandeur, ni dans la
grosseur, des rejettons</i>;” and he even says that the stumps “<i>conduisent plutôt leurs rejettons à
une parfaite maturité, pourvûs qu’on ait soin de rechausser les souches</i>,” &amp;c.&mdash;Nouveau
Voyage &amp;c. tom. iii. p. 368.</p>
<p class="pfc4">I had previously read the following passage in another work, “<i>Dans les plantations
situées au bord du Demerari on fait trente recoltes successives de sucre sans transplanter les
cannes, &amp;c.</i>&mdash;Voyage a la Guiane &amp;c.” p. 222.</p>
<p class="pfc4">As this work is of doubtful reputation, I should not have cited any statement which was
made in it unless I was myself aware of its correctness, or unless the fact was mentioned
by other writers; but when Labat speaks of the same thing, there must be some foundation
for the statement.</p>

<p class="pfn4"><span class="ln1"><a name="Footnote_147_147" id="Footnote_147_147"></a><a href="#FNanchor_147_147"><span class="label">[147]</span></a></span>
Labat says, “<i>Toutes les terres, en un mot qui sont neuves, c’est-à-dire qui n’ont jamais
été planteés, ni semées, dans lesquelles on met des cannes aussi-tôt qu’on a abbatu les arbres qui les
couvroient, portent des cannes trés grosses et en quantité, remplis de beaucoup de suc, mais gras,
crud, peu sucré, trés difficile à cuire et à purifier. Je me suis trouvé quelquefois dans ces circonstances
et particulierement à la Guadeloupe, ou ayant fait défricher une terre neuve, à plus
d’une lieüe du bord de la mer, et l’ayant plantée en cannes c’etoit quelque chose de surprenant
de voir le nombre, la grosseur et la hauteur de ces cannes, lorsqu’elles n’avoient encore que six
mois; cependant je les fis couper a cet âge, et après que j’eus retiré ce dont j’avois besoin pour
planter, je fis faire de l’eau-de-vie du reste, et je fis mettre le feu au terrain pour consumer les
pailles, dont la pourriture n’auroit servi qu’à augmenter la graisse de la terre. Quatorze mois
aprés cette coupe, je fis employer en sucre blanc les rejettons qui étoient crûs, dont la bonté repondit
parfaitement à la beauté, qui ne pouvoit être plus grande.</i>”&mdash;Nouveau Voyage &amp;c.
tom. iii. p. 339.</p>
<p class="pfc4">His account of this affair still continues, but I have transcribed the more important part
of it.</p>
<p class="pfc4">The master of the grammar school at Itamaraca, told me that he acted in the same manner
with respect to a quantity of cane which he once planted upon a piece of land that
was afterwards cultivated by me; he was satisfied that this was the better plan, when the
land is in the state which Labat describes; but the people in general thought that he was
mad, until crop time came, and then they changed their opinion.</p>
<p class="pfc4">In another work Labat says, “<i>le terrain nouvellement défriché, étant naturellement gras et
humide, et sa situation le rendant encore aqueux, les cannes qu’il produit, sont à la vérité grosses,
grandes, pleines de suc; mais ce suc est gras et aqueux; il est par conséquent plus long à cuire,
plus difficile à purifier, de sorte qu’il faudra abbatre et mettre au moulin plus de cannes, purifier
et cuire plus de jus ou de suc pour faire une barrique de sucre, qu’il n’en faut à la Martinique
pour en faire quatre</i>.”&mdash;Voyage du Chevalier des Marchais a Cayenne, &amp;c. tom. iii. 204.
In the little experience which I had, I was surprised to find an increase or decrease in the
quantity of the product of the same number of cart loads of cane from different quarters of
the plantation; but my mind was then too much occupied to allow me to look for the cause
of this.</p>
<p class="pfc4">At the time that Labat wrote his account of the French portion of the Columbian islands,
(from 1693 to 1705) they were in a state which resembled much that of Brazil in the present
day; that is, the colonists were forming establishments and clearing lands; agriculture
was in a rude state, and as sugar colonies were then, comparatively speaking, new things,
improvements were daily striking the thinking men who went out to those places; for it was
a subject to which intellect was at that time turned. The system in the Columbian islands
has now been much benefited, by the advanced state of the mother countries which possess
them; and the communication between the islands belonging to the several powers which
rule them, has led them to adopt and to profit by each other’s inventions and ideas. But
Brazil has been left to its own resources; no interest has been taken in its concerns from
without, nor has any regard been paid to the mental advancement of the people belonging
to it, so that it cannot be wondered at that the country should have made very little progress.
However the similarity of the state of the French islands in the time of Labat, to that of
Brazil at the present day, and his powers of observation, induce me to think that some of
his remarks may be useful in the latter country, although they may be out of date in the
places of which he wrote. Thus much I say, as a reason for making frequent notes from
him.</p>

Labat speaks of seeing canes planted down to the water’s edge at Guadaloupe; he
says that he tasted the juice of some of them, and found it to be rather brackish; “<i>d’où il
étoit aisé de conclure que le sucre brut qu’on en feroit, pourroit être beau, comme il l’etoit en effet
en tout le quartier du grand cul-de-sac, mais qu’il seroit difficile de réussir en sucre blanc, comme
il est arrivé</i>.”&mdash;Nouveau Voyage, &amp;c. tom. iii. p.71.</p>

Besides the usual mode of holing, Mr. Edwards mentions the following method;
“the planter instead of stocking up his ratoons, and holing and planting the land
anew, suffers the stoles to continue in the ground and contents himself, as his cane fields
become thin and impoverished, by supplying the vacant spaces with fresh plants.”&mdash;History
of the West Indies, vol. ii. p. 207.</p>

The author of the <i>Nouveau Voyage &amp;c.</i> <i>tom.</i> iii. p. 218. mentions having covered
the claying house belonging to a mill, the property of his Order, with the tops of the
sugar cane. I never saw this practised in Brazil, and indeed Labat says, that they were
not commonly put to this purpose in the parts of which he writes. He says, that a species
of reed was usually employed. In Brazil there is a kind of grass which answers the purpose,
and is durable; and this quality, Labat says, that the cane tops possess; however in Brazil
the leaves of the coco and of other palms are generally used.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Although it was the general custom to employ the cane tops for planting, Labat objects
to them from his own authority, upon the score of these not possessing sufficient strength
to yield good canes. The same opinion is general in Pernambuco.</p>

Labat lays great stress upon the ripeness of the canes. “<i>Il faut donc observer avant
que de couper les cannes quel est leur degré de perfection et de maturité plutôt que leur âge</i>,” <i>&amp;c.</i>&mdash;Nouveau
Voyage, &amp;c. tom. iii. p. 353.</p>
<p class="pfc4">But when a plantation has a large crop, it is absolutely impossible to attend so particularly
to the ripeness as he inculcates; some of the cane must be ground unripe, and
other parts of the field cannot be cut until after the proper time.</p>

<p class="pfn4"><span class="ln1"><a name="Footnote_154_154" id="Footnote_154_154"></a><a href="#FNanchor_154_154"><span class="label">[154]</span></a></span>
The French friar complains of the rats, and says that there was in his time a <i>chasseur
de rats</i> upon every estate. He says that he made his <i>chasseur</i> bring the rats that were
caught to him; and he desired to have the whole rat, for if the heads or tails only came,
the bodies were eaten by the negroes, which he wished to prevent, as he thought that this
food brought on consumption. I know that the negroes in Brazil eat every rat which they
can catch, and I do not see why they should not be well tasted and wholesome food, for they
feed on sugar-cane and mandioc. I cannot refrain from transcribing the following statement:
“<i>Il y a des habitans qui se contentent que le preneur de rats leur en apporte les quëues
ou les têtes. C’est une mauvaise methode, parce que les preneurs voisins s’accordent ensemble et
portent les quëues d’un côté et les têtes d’autre, afin de profiter de la recompense que les maîtres
donnent, sans se mettre beaucoup en peine de tendre les attrapes.</i>”&mdash;Nouveau Voyage, &amp;c.,

The author of the <i>Noveau Voyage, &amp;c.</i> says, the Portugueze, when they first established

make use of mills for grinding the sugar cane similar to those of Normandy, “<i>pour briser
les pommes à faire le cidre, et dont on se sert aux päis ou il y a des oliviers, pour écraser les

The following method of preparing the <i>temper</i> will be useful in the country of which
I am treating, and therefore I think I may be permitted to insert it, although it is long.</p>
<p class="pfc4">“<i>Le barril à lessive étant posé sur la sellette ou sur un trépied, on en bouche le trou avec une
quantité de paille longue et entiere, aprés quoi on y met une couche composée des herbes suivantes,
aprés les avoir broyées entre ses mains, et aprés les avoir hachées.</i></p>
<p class="pfc4">“<i>Herbes à blé; c’est une herbe qui croît par touffes comme le blé qui est levé depuis deux ou
trois mois, et à qui elle ressemble beaucoup. On arrache la touffe entiere avec sa racine qui est
fort petite.</i></p>
<p class="pfc4">“<i>La seconde se nomme herbe à pique. Cette plante a une tige droite de la grosseur d’un
tuyau de plume d’oye et de la hauteur de quinze à dix-huit pouces. Son extrémité porte une feüille
comme celle de l’ozeille pour la couleur et pour la consistance, mais qui ressemble entiérement au
fer d’une pique.</i></p>
<p class="pfc4">“<i>La troisiéme est la mal-nommée. C’est une petite herbe déliée, fine et frizée à peu près
comme les cheveux des négres.</i></p>
<p class="pfc4">“<i>On met ces trois sortes d’herbes par portion égale, avec quelques feüilles et quelques morceaux
de lianne brûlante. Cette lianne est une espéce de lierre, dont la feüille est plus tendre,
plus mince et les bois plus spongieux que le lierre d’Europe. On écrase un peu le bois et les
feüilles, avant que de les mettre dans le barril. C’est avec ces quatre sortes d’herbes qu’on garnit
le fond du barril jusqu’ à trois pouces de hauteur; on les couvre d’un lit de cendre de pareille
épaisseur, et l’on choisit la cendre faite du meilleur bois qu’on ait brûlé, comme sont le chataignier,
le bois rouge, le bois caraibe, le raisinier, l’oranger ou autres bois durs, dont les cendres et
les charbons sont remplis de beaucoup de sel. On met sur cette couche de cendre une couche de chaux
vive de même épaisseur, et sur celle-ci une autre couche des mêmes herbes, ausquelles on ajoûte une
ou deux cannes d’inde ou de seguine bâtarde, amorties au feu, et coupées par ruelles de l’épaisseur
d’un ecu. Cette plante vient sur le bord des eaux marécageuses, sa tige est ronde d’un pouce ou
environ de diamétre; sa peau est fort mince et fort verte; le dedans est blanc, assez compacte,
et rempli d’une liqueur extrémement mordicante, qui fait une vilaine tache, et ineffaçable sur le
linge et sur les étoffes où elle tombe. Sa feüille est tout-a-fait semblable pour la figure à celle de
la porée ou bette, mais elle est plus verte et plus lisse, et ses fibres ne se distinguent presque pas;
on ne les met point dans la lessive. Toutes ces herbes sont extrémement corrosives et mordicantes.
On remplit ainsi le barril de cendre, de chaux, et d’herbes, par lits jusqu’à ce qu’il soit plein, et on
le termine par une couche des mêmes herbes bien broyées et hachées. Quand on se sert des
cendres qui viennent de sortir des fourneaux, et qui sont encore toutes brûlantes, on remplit
le barril avec de l’eau froide; mais lorsque les cendres sont froides, on fait boüiller l’eau
avant que de la mettre dans le barril. On met un pot ou un autre vaisseau sous le trou
qui est bouché de paille, pour recevoir l’eau qui en dégoûte, que l’on remet dans le barril,
et que l’on fait passer sur le marc qu’il contient, jusqu’à ce que cette lessive devienne si
forte que la mettant sur la langue avec le bout du doigt, on ne puisse pas l’y souffrir, et
qu’elle jaunisse le doigt, comme si c’étoit de l’eau forte.</i>”&mdash;Nouveau Voyage, tom. iv. p. 33 to 35.</p>

A few of the more wealthy planters have sent for large stills from England, and have,
of course, found their infinite superiority over those in common use.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Even in the time of Labat, his countrymen were much before the Pernambucan planters
respecting the arrangement of the still-houses. They had copper stills.</p>

The <i>alvarà</i> was passed the 21st January, 1809. One to the same effect had been passed
on the 22d September, 1758, for the captaincy of Rio de Janeiro; this was extended to other
captaincies, at first as a temporary law, but it was afterwards several times renewed; and
it was at last allowed to be in force in all the ultra-marine dominions of Portugal, by
the <i>alvarà</i> of the 6th July, 1807. However as there were some restrictions attached to
this law, that of 1809 was passed. By this last, in the first place, executions cannot be
made upon sugar estates which are in a working state and do work regularly, and that have
under cultivation that quantity of ground which is requisite for the carrying on of the work
of the mill, and for the support of the slaves; executions can only be carried into effect
upon one third of the net produce of such plantations; the other two thirds being left for
the expences of cultivation, and for the administration, that is, for the support of the
owner.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Secondly. Executions can however be made if the debt is equal to or above the value
of the estate; but the whole of the slaves, the cattle, the lands, and the implements belonging
to the <i>engenho</i> must form one valuation, nor can they be separated; but they must
all be taken as parts of the <i>engenho</i>.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Thirdly. If there are more debts than one, and these together make up the sum which
may cause the plantation to be subject to execution, still some law proceedings must
be entered into, by which these several debts may be placed in such a form as to be considered
as one debt. Thus the government does those things which ought not to be done,
and leaves undone those things which ought to be done.</p>

I have seen some fine cotton shrubs at the distance of one or two leagues, and even less,
from the sea coast; but the attempts that have been made to cultivate it to any extent in such
situations, have not, from what I have seen and heard, met with the desired success. Might
not the Sea-Island seed be sent for, and a trial of it made? The Pernambuco cotton is superior
to that of every other part, excepting the small quantity which is obtained from
those islands.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Bolingbroke, in his “Voyage to the Demerary,” says that “On the sea coast the British
settlers also commenced the culture of cotton, and found that land to answer much better
than the soil up the river.”&mdash;In Phillips’ Collection, &amp;c. p. 81.</p>
<p class="pfc4">The cotton of the settlements upon the part of South America of which he writes, is very
inferior to that of Pernambuco.</p>
<p class="pfc4">In the Third Report of the Directors of the African Institution, p. 23, I find it stated,
that “the saline air of the sea-shore, which generally destroys coffee, is favourable to
cotton;” at p. 27, it is said that cotton never fails to degenerate “when it has been propagated
in the same ground for many years without a change of seed.”</p>

I have heard that the seeds would form a very good food for cattle, if they could be

In Labat’s time these machines were likewise worked by the feet of the person who
was employed in thrusting the cotton against the rollers.</p>

Mr. Edwards calls the species of the cotton plant which is cultivated in the Columbian
islands, the <i>common Jamaica</i>, of which “the staple is coarse but strong.” It is difficult to
clean, owing to the brittleness of the seeds. It is strange, as Mr. Edwards remarks, that
the British cotton planters should be acquainted with species of the shrub which produce
finer wool, and yet continue to rear this inferior quality.</p>

The following is a statement of the export of cotton from Pernambuco, from the
year 1808 to 1813. It was furnished to me by my friend Mr. I. C. Pagen, who resided
at Recife during a considerable part of the time.</p>

<p class="pfc4 p1">From this it would appear that in saying, at chapter 1st, that the export from thence at
the present time is between 80,000 and 90,000 bags annually, I have over-rated the real
number. But it will be seen that the increase has been considerable from 1812 to 1813,
and I know that it still continues to increase as rapidly, if not more so.</p>

Mr. Southey says, “When the mandioc failed, what was called stick flour (in Portugueze
<i>farinha de pao</i>) was made from the wood of the Urucuri-iba, which they cut in
pieces and bruised; and this being less liable to corrupt than the mandioc, is now generally
used in the Brazilian ships.” vol. i. p. 233. The <i>farinha de pao</i> which is at present
used in these ships, is made from the mandioc, and the name of stick-flour is by no means
inapposite; for it always requires to be picked before it is used, to take out the bits of the
husk and of the hardened fibres of the root which may chance to remain. But the name
may have, and most probably did, commence with the stick-flour of the Urucuri-iba; and
when the substance from which it was made was changed, the name still continued. I refer
the reader to the History of Brazil for a farther account of the mandioc.</p>

Du Tertre gives three remedies for those who have drank of the juice. “<i>Le premier
que j’ay veu pratiquer heureusement c’est de boire de l’huile d’olive avec de l’eau tiede, ce
qui fait vomir tout ce qu’on a pris; le second qui est tres-assuré est de boire quantité de suc
d’ananas, avec quelques goutes de jus de citron; mais sur tous les remedes, le suc de l’herbe aux
couleuvres, dont tous les arbres de ces isles sont revêtus, est le souverain antidote, non seulement
contre ce mal, mais encore contre toute sorte de venin.</i>”&mdash;Histoire des Antilles, &amp;c.
tom. ii. p. 118.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Labat does not believe in the virtue of the <i>herbe de couleuvres</i> in this case.</p>

<p class="pfc4">Likewise in the “<i>Voyage a la Guiane</i>,” p. 101, “<i>Le suc de manioc cet instrument de mort
devient, travaillé par les creoles de Cayenne, une sauce appétissante et salutaire</i>.”</p>
<p class="pfc4">
“The juice is boiled with meat and seasoned, and makes excellent soup, which is termed
casserepo, and used in pepper-pot and sauces.”&mdash;Voyage to the Demerary, &amp;c. by H.
Bolingbroke, p. 149.</p>
<p class="pfc4">
Dr. Pinckard mentions having tasted in the colony of Demerary of the juice of the cassada
prepared as sauce.&mdash;Notes on the West-Indies, vol. ii. p. 257.</p>
<p class="pfc4">During the famine of 1793, the people of Pernambuco made use of the juice as food; but
in times of plenty it is regarded as being unfit for any purpose. It is by evaporation that
it loses its poisonous qualities.</p>

<p class="pfn4"><span class="ln1"><a name="Footnote_177_177" id="Footnote_177_177"></a><a href="#FNanchor_177_177"><span class="label">[177]</span></a></span>
Du Tertre speaks of a species of harmless mandioc, which is called <i>Kamanioc</i>, and
he adds, that it is <i>assez rare</i>.&mdash;Histoire des Antilles, &amp;c. tom. ii. p. 114.</p>
<p class="pfc4">
Labat likewise speaks of the <i>Camanioc</i>, “<i>comme qui diroit le chef des maniocs. En effet son
bois, ses feüilles et ses racines sont plus grandes et plus grosses que les autres maniocs. Mais
comme il est beaucoup plus long tems à crôitre et à mûrir, et que ses racines rendent beaucoup
moins de farine parce qu’elles sont plus legéres et plus spongieuses que les autres, on le neglige
et peu de gens en plantent.</i>”&mdash;Nouveau Voyage, &amp;c. tom. i. p. 411.</p>
<p class="pfc4">It is not only the root of the <i>macaxeira</i> which is smaller, but the plant is, I think, altogether
smaller than the other species.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Barrere, in the <i>Nouvelle Relation de la France Equinoxiale</i>, p. 61, speaks of the harmless
species under the name of <i>maniok sauvage</i>.</p>

<p class="pfn4"><span class="ln1"><a name="Footnote_178_178" id="Footnote_178_178"></a><a href="#FNanchor_178_178"><span class="label">[178]</span></a></span>
Barrere says, speaking of Cayenne, “<i>Les Creoles préferent encore au meilleur pain du
monde la cassave qu’elles mange rarement séche; car elles la font toujours tremper dans l’eau ou
dans quelque sauce: c’est sans doute cette nourriture qui leur donne cette couleur pâle, et qui fait
qu’elles n’ont point de coloris</i>.” I am afraid he does not look quite far enough for the want
of colour in the ladies of Cayenne.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Then again, he says, “<i>On ne mange que trés rarement a Cayenne, ou pour mieux dire,
presque jamais de la Coaque, qui est la nourriture ordinaire des Portugais de Parà, du Maragnan,
et des peuples, qui sont sur les rivages du fleuve des Amazones</i>.” He describes the <i>coaque</i>;
and it is clearly the <i>farinha</i>, but he does not explain how the <i>cassave</i> was made, of which
the creole ladies were so fond, and which did them so much mischief.</p>
<p class="pfc4">He says afterwards, “<i>Les Indiens Portugais, quand ils veulent prendre leurs repas, ils mettent
une poignée de coaque dans le creux de la main, qui leur sert d’assiette; et de là ils la font
sauter adroitement dans la bouche; l’on boit par dessus une bonne coüye d’eau et de boisson; et
voila leur repas pris.</i>”&mdash;Nouvelle Relation de la France Equinoxiale, p. 55, and 56.</p>
<p class="pfc4">This mode of eating and the abstemiousness of the repast are both common in Brazil
to all casts of people. With respect to the <i>cassave</i>, I cannot comprehend what he means.
But, contrary to his notion, to eat <i>farinha</i> in the manner that he mentions quite dry,
although it is done by most people, is not reckoned wholesome. In fact, it is one of the
duties of a <i>feitor</i> or manager to see that the negroes do not make their meals with dry
<i>farinha</i>, but he should see that they make <i>piram</i>; this is done by mixing the flour with
boiling water or gravy. The negroes do not dislike <i>piram</i>, but they are sometimes too
idle or too much fatigued to take the trouble of cooking their victuals; and therefore they
eat the <i>farinha</i> dry, and their salt meat with it, after having smoke-dried the latter upon a
wooden skewer. The disorder which is said to proceed from constantly eating dry <i>farinha</i>
is the dropsy. The flour of the mandioc swells considerably when it is moistened: if the
expansion takes place in the stomach it may be injurious, and this may perhaps afford
some reason for the opinion of the Brazilians upon the subject.</p>

<p class="pfn4"><span class="ln1"><a name="Footnote_179_179" id="Footnote_179_179"></a><a href="#FNanchor_179_179"><span class="label">[179]</span></a></span>
Du Tertre mentions the same practice,&mdash;of steeping the mandioc, and says that the
savages were in the habit “<i>de la sécher au soleil et l’ecorce s’ostant d’elle-mesme, ils pillent le
manyoc dans un mortier, pour le reduire en farine, qu’ils mangent sans autre cuisson</i>.”&mdash;Histoire
des Antilles, &amp;c. tom. ii. p. 114.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Labat says, that the maroon negroes used to prepare it in the two following ways. “<i>C’est
de la couper par morceaux, et de le mettre tremper dans l’eau courante des rivieres ou des ravines
pendant sept ou huit heures. Le movement de l’eau ouvre les pores de la racine et entraîne
ce trop de substance. La seconde maniere est de le mettre cuire tout entier sous la braise. L’action
du feu met ses parties en mouvement et on le mange comme on fait des chataignes ou des patates
sans aucune crainte.</i>”&mdash;Nouveau Voyage, &amp;c. tom. i. p. 410.</p>
<p class="pfc4">I think the said negroes must have been accustomed by degrees to eating the mandioc in
this manner. I should not be willing to recommend either of these ways of cooking it.</p>

<p class="pfc4">Labat does not however vouch for the truth of the statement. He speaks of the cabbage
of the coco-tree being very good; and I agree with him. A coco-tree was cut down
at Itamaraca, and the vicar sent me the cabbage of which several dishes were made, and
they were excellent.</p>

to be so valuable in the dying trade, that an offer was immediately made of sixty guineas <i>per</i>

The long banana or plantain appears to be of much more importance in Demarary
and the adjoining colonies, for Mr. Bolingbroke says, “This coast (between the Essequibo
and Pomaroon rivers) possesses a considerable advantage over the other sea-coasts,
from its being able to rear any quantity of plantains.”&mdash;Voyage to the Demarary, &amp;c.
p. 115; and at p. 87, he speaks of the same fruit being the “negroes’ chief food.”</p>
<p class="pfc4">Labat mentions a means of rendering the banana serviceable in travelling; and as the
ingredients of his receipt are all of them good, the mixture must, I should imagine, be
likewise good, and therefore I insert it for the benefit of those who may, as I have been, be
much in want of something palatable, when crossing the Seará-Meirim. “<i>Ceux qui veulent
faire cette pâte avec plus de soin, font d’abord sécher les bananes au four ou au soleil, puis ils
les gragent, ils y mêlent ensuite du sucre pilé, avec un peu de poudre de canelle, de géroffle et
de gingembre, tant soit peu de farine et un blanc d’œuf pour lier toutes ces choses ensemble, après
qu’elles ont été paitries avec un peu d’eau de fleur d’orange.</i>”&mdash;Nouveau Voyage, &amp;c. tom.
iii. p. 314. Fewer ingredients might be made use of.</p>
<p class="pfc4">
Du Tertre says of the banana, “<i>Quand on le coupe on voit une belle croix imprimeé sur
chaque tronçon; c’est qui a fait croire à plusieurs que ce fruit est le même qu’Adam mangea
dans le Paradis terrestre</i>,” <i>&amp;c.</i>&mdash;Histoire des Antilles, &amp;c. tom. ii. p. 140.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Labat speaks of the same story, but adds, “<i>Adam pouvoit avoir meilleure vûë que
nous, ou la croix de ces bananes étoit mieux formée</i>.”&mdash;Nouveau Voyage, &amp;c. tom iii. p. 307.
I was once desired by a Brazilian woman of colour to cut the banana lengthways, and
not across, for by the latter manner of dividing the fruit, I should cut the <i>Cruz de
Nosso Senhor</i>, Our Saviour’s Cross.</p>

champ on en plante d’autres, mais en moindre quantité, c’est a dire, qu’on ne met qu’un rang
de fosses au milieu des allées</i>;” and he recommends that the water-melon, the common
melon, and such like plants should be sown between the mandioc and the cacao-trees.&mdash;Nouveau

black Ipecacuanha was only to be found near to the gold mines in the interior of Rio de

epithet of <i>gris</i>, and he likewise mentions the white kind; both of these, he says, answer the
same purpose as the black, but a larger dose is required.&mdash;Nouveau Voyage, &amp;c.

“Vieyra, in his letters, mentions a received tradition that Emanuel ordered all the

the only spice which escaped, because it was under-ground. He does not appear to have
recollected the impossibility of carrying such an order into effect upon a continent.”&mdash;History

“On one article, guinea-grains or malagueta-pepper, the duty has been doubled; not
with a view of increasing the revenue, but of operating as a prohibition of the use of
it, as it is supposed to have been extensively employed in the brewing of malt-liquor. The
Directors however have great reason to doubt the existence of the deleterious qualities
ascribed to this drug; as they find it to be universally esteemed in Africa one of the most
wholesome of spices, and generally used by the natives to season their food.”&mdash;Fourth
Report of the Directors of the African Institution, p. 16.</p>
<p class="pfc4">If this article and the <i>malagueta</i> of Brazil are the same, I should be strongly inclined to
agree with the Report; and indeed I conceive that it is not only harmless but extremely
wholesome. A decoction of the pods is used among the peasantry as an injection in aguish
disorders.</p>

abuse d’une negre, l’enfant mulastre qui en vient est libre, et le pere est obligé de le nourrir et

the king took the islands from the Companies which had held them during his pleasure.&mdash;Nouveau

civil, military, and ecclesiastical; but the bishop is a Brazilian, and so is the <i>ouvidor</i>.</p>

The term of <i>Senhor</i> or <i>Senhora</i> is made use of to all free persons, whites, mulattos,
and blacks, and in speaking to a freeman of whatever class or colour the manner of address
is the same. Dr. Pinckard says, in his “Notes on the West Indies,” “the title of Mrs.
seems to be reserved solely for the ladies from Europe, and the white Creoles, and to
form a distinction between them and the women of colour of all classes and descriptions.”</p>

To this statement some explanation is necessary, owing to the regulations of the Portugueze
military service. Privates are sometimes raised to commissions by the intermediate
steps of corporals, quarter-masters, and sergeants; these men gain their ensigncies
without any relation to their birth; and though a decidedly dark coloured mulatto
might not be so raised, a European of low birth would. It is to enable a man to
become a cadet and then an officer without serving in the ranks, that requires nobility of
birth.</p>

There was a rumour of the appointment of a white man as colonel of this regiment,
and also of a white colonel for the Recife mulatto regiment; and I was asked by
several individuals of these casts whether there was any truth in the report. I cannot
believe any thing of this kind; the liberal policy which seems to pervade the Council of
Rio de Janeiro forbids that such a report should be believed; but if this should be true,
most pernicious will be the consequences, which from such a determination may be
expected to proceed.</p>

The priests of the island of St. Thomé, upon the coast of Africa, are negroes. I
have seen some of these men at Recife, who have come over for a short time. I have
heard that they are prohibited from saying Mass any where excepting upon the island for
which they are ordained; but I can scarcely think that this can be correct. In the <i>Voyage
du Chevalier des Marchais en Guinée, isles voisines et a Cayenne</i>, I find that men of
mixed blood were ordained in the islands of St. Thomé and Principe, and the editor of
the work says, “<i>presque tout le clergé de la cathedrale</i> (of St. Thome) <i>étoit de cette couleur</i>.”
Vol. iii. p. 4. “<i>L’Eglise de S. Antoine qui est la Paroisse</i> (of Prince’s Island) <i>est déservie

<p class="pfc4">I have, as is stated in the text, heard from good authority, that the law forbids the ordination
of mulattos; what the practice is I am quite certain, and I hope the law may be
favourable also.</p>

<p class="pfc4">I give this statement, and should be happy to transcribe any other, with which I might
meet in the course of reading, of the same tenor; but it must be recollected that the “Voyage

The owner of a sugar plantation, with whose sons I was well acquainted, possessed a
slave, who had the management of the sugar boiling house during crop time, and who
was accounted by all who knew him and understood the business, to be a most excellent
workman.&mdash;This man accumulated a sum of money, which he offered to his master for
his freedom, but it was not accepted; and although the slave made great interest with
persons of consideration in the country, he could not accomplish his end. His master
loaded him with irons, and he was made to work in this state. He did not obtain his
liberty till after his master’s death, when the widow received his money, and manumitted
him. His trade of sugar-boiler renders him large profits yearly, and this injured man
now lives in ease and comfort. This instance of refusal, and some others of which I have
heard, would make me doubtful of the foundation upon which the custom of manumitting
is placed, if I did not know how easily the laws relating to many other important
points are evaded through the influence of wealth and power. I did not see a copy of the
law or regulation on the subject, but I never met with any one who made a doubt of its
existence. I never met with any one who doubted that the slave had a right to appeal, if
he thought proper; whether he would be heard or not was another question.</p>

The major part of the slaves that abscond, are brought back to their owners, but
some do escape, and are never afterwards heard of. They remove to some distant district
and there reside as free men. Those who have once tasted of the sweets of free agency,
for any length of time, even if they are brought back to their masters, scarcely ever remain
longer than is requisite to seek an opportunity of eluding the vigilance of those
whose business it is to watch them; they soon brave the risk of another detection. A
young and handsome mulatto man of these unsettled habits once applied to me to purchase
him. He had by mere accident been discovered only a short time before, by a
friend of his master in the Sertam, where he had married a free woman, and had been
considered as free himself. He was brought back to his master, was sold to another person,
escaped, returned, and again fled, and had not, when I left the country, been heard
of for a twelvemonth.</p>

The following circumstances occurred under my own observation:&mdash;A negress had
brought into the world ten children, and had reared nine of them. These remained to
work for their owners; the woman claimed her freedom, for the tenth child did not die
until it had arrived at an age when it did not require any farther care from her; but it
was refused. She was hired to a gentleman as a nurse for one of his children. This
person did all in his power to obtain her freedom, but did not succeed; he purchased her,
and immediately had a deed of manumission made out by a notary-public. When he
returned home to dinner, he desired his wife to tell the woman that she was his slave,
and in the course of the day the deed was given to her. When I left the country, her
only fear was, that as she was free, her master and mistress might turn her away; thus
proving, by her anxiety, how happy she was.</p>

<p class="pfc4">Fellow slaves, or free persons of colour, are usually the sponsors in Brazil; but it is
better, I think, that fellow-slaves, that is, belonging to the same master, should be sponsors,
for they take a considerable interest in their god-children. The god-child, indeed,
in any of the ranks of life, never approaches either of its sponsors without begging for
their blessing. Labat, in speaking of a negro whom he had made <i>renoncer tous ses
pactes implicites et explicites qu’il pouvoit avoir fait avec le diable</i>, says,&mdash;“<i>Je chargeai sont
maitre, qui étoit aussi son parrain de vieller soigneusement sur sa conduite</i>.”&mdash;Nouveau
Voyage, &amp;c. tom. ii. p.54.</p>
<p class="pfc4">I never heard of the master in Brazil being likewise the god-father, nor do I think
that this ever happens; for such is the connection between two persons which this is supposed
to produce, that the master would never think of ordering the slave to be chastised.</p>

The same occurs in the Spanish and French colonies. Du Tertre, who seems from
the general tenor of his work, to have been a much better man than friars usually are,
speaks of the difficulty of converting the Caribs, and of their indifference to religion, and
then adds, “<i>Mais les négres sont certainement touchez de Dieu, puis qu’ils conservent, jusqu’à la
mort, la religion qu’ils ont embrassée; qu’ils en pratiquent les vertus et en exercent les œuvres,
et je puis dire avec verité qu’ils y vivent bien plus Chrestiennement dans leur condition, que
beaucoup de François</i>.”&mdash;Histoire des Antilles, tom. ii. p. 502.</p>

Labat says that the inhabitants of St. Domingo were in the habit of marking the
negroes which they bought by burning the skin, and he adds, in his Dominican way, “<i>De
sorte qu’un esclave qui auroit été vendu et revendu plusieurs fois paroîtroit à la fin aussi chargé
de caracters, que ces obelisques d’Egypt</i>.” This was not practised, as he tells us, in the
islands (Martinique and Guadaloupe) and he adds that their negroes, and principally the
creole slaves <i>seroient au desespoir qu’on les marquât comme on fait les bœufs et les chevaux</i>.
The small islands did not require this practice, but St. Domingo <i>un pais aussi vaste</i>, could
not do without it, because the slaves ran away to the mountains.&mdash;Nouveau Voyage, &amp;c.,
tom. vii. p. 260.</p>
<p class="pfc4">The St. Domingo planters have paid severely for all their misdeeds, and therefore of
them nothing need to be said in the present day. The vastness, however, of Brazil, which
is a little more <i>vaste</i> than St. Domingo, does not require that the slaves should be marked
like cattle.</p>

The base, the most abominable practice of some masters and mistresses, <i>and of the latter
oftener than the former</i>, increases the bias which these miserable, these uneducated beings
must be expected to have towards licentiousness. Females have been punished because
they have not increased the number of their owners’ slaves. This is a fact; but it is almost
too much to believe. On which side does the extreme of depravity lie?</p>

The following circumstances occurred within my own observation. A negro woman
applied to a planter to be purchased, for which purpose she had brought a note from her
master. She was accepted, and a bargain was concluded between the two persons; however,
the day after she had taken up her abode upon the estate of her new master, she
came to him, and falling down upon her knees, said that she had had a fellow-slave who
wished likewise to serve him, and she begged him to purchase her companion. The new
master spoke to the owner of the slave in question on the subject, but he refused to sell
him, and the matter rested in this manner; but on the third day, he received a visit from
the owner, offering the slave for sale, adding that the man had refused to work, and had
threatened to hang himself; and as he was a <i>Gabam</i> negro, he much feared that he might
put his threat in execution. The price was soon fixed, and on the following morning the
man made his appearance. He proved to be a most excellent slave.</p>

The following occurrences took place upon the estate of a wealthy planter to the South
of Recife, and the anecdote was related by the owner of the plantation himself. A negro
complained to his master of the infidelity of his wife; she was immediately questioned;
and other enquiries being made, and the truth of the statement respecting her conduct
being proved, she was tied to a post to be flogged. Her husband was present, and at first
he rather received pleasure from the sight of her sufferings; but he soon stopped the
driver’s hand, and going to his master, begged him to order her to be unbound, and that
he would pardon her, for he added, “If there are to be so many men, and so small a
number of women upon the estate, how is it to be expected that the latter are to be faithful.”

The ships which are employed in this trade oftentimes fill some of their water casks
with salt water, when they leave Brazil, that they may serve as ballast; and on taking their
live cargo on board upon the coast of Africa, the salt water is replaced by that which is
for the use of the additional number of persons. On one occasion a vessel had proceeded
for some days on her voyage from Africa towards Brazil with a full cargo, when the discovery
was made that the casks had not been filled with fresh water. The coast of either
continent was too distant to enable the vessel to reach one or the other, before the greatest
distress must be experienced, and therefore a most shocking expedient was resorted to,&mdash;a
great number of the negroes were thrown overboard. This misfortune was accidental and
occurred unintentionally, and a man must have been in a similar situation before he can
declare that he would not act as the Portugueze did on this occasion; but the circumstances
arose from the nature of this execrable trade.</p>

I was present on one occasion at the purchase of some slaves. The person who
was chusing those which suited his purpose, singled out among others a handsome woman,
and a beautiful boy of about six years old. The woman had been a slave at Loanda
upon the coast of Africa, and she spoke a little Portugueze. Whilst the selection
was going on, the slave-dealer had happened to leave the room; but after it was concluded
he returned, and seeing the persons who had been set apart to be purchased, said,
he was sorry the woman and child could not be sold, for they formed part of a lot
which could not be separated. The purchaser enquired the reason of the formation of a
lot in this instance, and was answered that it consisted of a family, the husband, wife, and
three children. The dealer was then requested to point out the individuals which composed
it, and they were all bought together. How few slave-merchants would have acted
in this manner! The whole family was present during the greatest part of the time, but
there was no change of countenance in either the husband or the wife,&mdash;both of them
understood the Portugueze language; the children were almost too young to know what
was about to happen, and besides we spoke in a language which <i>they</i> did not understand.
That their parents did feel deeply the separation which they must have apprehended as
being upon the point of taking place, I have not the slightest doubt, because I frequently
saw these slaves afterwards, and knew how much they were attached to each other
and to their children. But whether it proceeded from resignation, from despair, from fear,
or from being ashamed to shew what they felt before so many strangers, there was no demonstration
of feeling. Negroes may have feelings, and yet not allow the standers-by to
know what they feel.</p>

An instance occurred at Liverpool of the attachment of some of these people to
their master. At the commencement of the direct trade from Brazil to Great Britain,
some small vessels came to Liverpool manned in part with slaves, owing to their
masters being ignorant that their arrival upon British ground would make them
free. However the men themselves were soon made acquainted with this circumstance,
and many of them availed themselves of the advantages which were to be thus obtained.
One of the men belonging to a small bark left his vessel, and having entered himself as a
seaman on board some other ship, returned to persuade three of his companions to do the
same; but he was answered, that they were well treated where they were, had always been
used kindly, and therefore had no wish to try any other way of life. These three men
returned to Brazil in the bark, and I have heard that they were set at liberty by their
master on their arrival there. I hope it was so. When the advocates of slavery relate
such stories as these, they give them as tending to prove that slaves in general are happy.
Anecdotes of this kind demonstrate individual goodness in the master and individual
gratitude in the slave, but they prove nothing generally; they do not affect the great question;
<i>that</i> is rested upon grounds which are too deeply fixed to be moved by single instances
of evil or of good.</p>

One of these old men, who was yet however sufficiently hearty to be often in a
state of intoxication, and would walk to a considerable distance to obtain liquor,
made a practice of coming to see me for this purpose. He would tell me, that he and his
companions were not slaves to the monks but to St. Bento himself, and that consequently,
the monks were only the representatives of their master for the due administration of the
Saint’s property in this world. I enquired of some others of the slaves, and found that
this was the general opinion among them.</p>

An old slave, who had been invariably well treated, for he had never deserved punishment,
was asked by his master if he wished to be free; he smiled, but said nothing; the
question being repeated, he answered that of course he wished to be free; the master then
told him that his deed of manumission should be drawn out that same day; upon this
being said, the slave shook his head, saying, “Why do you say such things to laugh at
your old black man.” However, as soon as he was persuaded that it was true, he
began to dance about like one who was mad, and for some minutes could answer no questions,
nor could any directions be given to him.</p>

The Saturday of each week is not sufficient for the slave to provide for his own
subsistence, unless the labour of his master, is done by task work, in which case, he may
manage to finish this in due time, and to work a little each day upon his own provision
grounds. He may indeed be able to live, by assisting the Saturdays, through the
labour of his Sundays and holidays, even if the labour of his master is not done by
piece-work; but this is not just, for to the Sundays and holidays he has a right as his
own, even if his master supports him; but slavery and justice seldom go hand in
hand.</p>

A planter with whom I was acquainted, was once seen by a person who happened to
call upon him, occupied with three of his companions in flogging four negroes; the men
were tied at a short distance from each other to four posts, and as the operation continued,
there was much laughing and joking, for as they lashed their miserable victims,
they cried out,&mdash;“Here is to the health of such and such a person.” It is some comfort
to be able to say, that this wretch has been ruined; but his ruin has been caused by his
treatment of his slaves, which has occasioned the death of some, and the escape of others
from his power in a less melancholy manner.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Another man, on ordering a slave to work in the sugar-mill, was answered, that he
was sick and could not go, but the master persisted. The negro went, saying, “you
will then kill your slave;” and vexed with the treatment which he received now, and had
suffered on other occasions, he placed his head near to one of the wheels, (for it was a
water-mill) by which it was severed from his body. I could mention many anecdotes of
this description, indicative of individual blackness of heart, such as have been related of
all nations who have had to do with slaves; but few will suffice. Neither of the stories
which are above related, occurred in the great and pre-eminent instance of depravity of
which the scene was the Mata, and which has been mentioned in a former part of this
work; in that case 55 slaves were consumed in less than fifteen years.</p>

Might not an act be passed for the British Colonies, obliging the master to manumit
his slave, on the fair value of the individual being tendered? However, this is not

I met with the following passage in a work of much reputation upon the affairs of
the British sugar islands. “The circumstance wherein the slaves in the West Indies seem
mostly indebted to their owners’ liberality are, I think, those of medical attendance and
accommodation when sick.” Would not a man take his horse to a farrier if any thing

Horses are usually marked upon the right haunch with the private mark of their
owners; but the beasts which have been bred by slaves are marked on the left haunch or
on the shoulder-blade. This proves, among many other corroborating circumstances, that
though the law may prohibit a slave from possessing property, custom has established a
practice which is better adapted to the present state of the country.</p>

The plan of distributing the new-comers among the old established negroes to be
taken care of by them, as is practised in Jamaica, has not been adopted in Brazil. I think
the effect of this must be good, for thus each established slave takes an interest in one of
his newly-arrived companions; the new slaves too may be sooner reconciled to their
situation, by the interest which is shewn in their behalf; and their wants may be made
known to the master with more ease. The law which was passed at Rio de Janeiro in
1809 (mentioned in chapter 16th) for preventing executions for debt upon the property
of sugar planters, may have one beneficial effect;&mdash;the slaves cannot, unless the master
pleases, be sold separately from the estate for the purpose of paying debts; the master
cannot be forced to dispose of them, unless the debt amounts to the value of the estate;
and thus the slave is advanced in some slight degree towards the condition of a serf.</p>

Dr. Pinckard, in his “Notes on the West-Indies” mentions that mercury was used
for the complaint at Berbice, with very little success. Mr. Edwards doubts “if medicine
of any kind is of use in this disease.” This writer likewise states that he had heard of the
Gold Coast negroes inoculating their children with the complaint, and also the notion
which they have of the disease getting into the bone. Bolingbroke says, “No effectual
cure has, I believe, ever been found for it. Salivation will drive it in, but sulphur and
other opening medicines are now preferred to induce its coming out;” and again “There
are black women who inoculate their children for this disorder; its violence is thereby lessened.”&mdash;Voyage

<p class="pfc4">In the “<i>Voyage à la Guiane et à Cayenne fait en 1789 et anneés suivantes</i>,” I find that
speaking of the same disorder, “<i>on la gagne trés-aisement avec les Indiennes qui en sont
presque toutes attaquées</i>.” It is supposed by Mr. Edwards to be brought from Africa, and
the same idea exists in Brazil; indeed it is less known among the Indians than among the
people of colour.</p>

A slave belonging to a colonel of militia, who was a planter of great wealth, was in
the frequent practice of concealing himself in the woods for some days at a time; on being
brought back, he was punished, and soon again ran away; and this behaviour continued
for some time. In one of his rambles he met his master, who was riding alone in one of
the narrow roads of the country. The slave placed himself in the middle of the path, and
taking off his hat, saluted his master as if he had been only slightly acquainted with him,
and addressed him, begging that he would give him some money. The colonel was much
alarmed, and granted his request, upon which he was suffered to proceed, but was admonished
to be silent upon the subject. The slave was soon taken; but he continued to
run away, to be brought home, to be punished, and again to go through the same proceeding
so frequently and for so many years, that at last his master allowed him to do as
he pleased; indeed he was somewhat afraid of a second meeting in the woods, when he
might not perhaps be treated so courteously. He as obstinately refused to sell the negro
as the negro objected to serving him; because he knew that the slave wished to be sold to
some one else, and from a notion which some of the planters entertain of not choosing to dispose
of any person whom they have owned, unless by manumission.</p>

There was a boy of twelve years of age, of African birth, who belonged to Jaguaribe;
this child often inhabited the woods for several days together. He killed a calf on one occasion,
and separated the quarters of the animal by means of a sharp stone. He was discovered
by the dropping of the blood, from the field to the hiding-place. As soon as the
owner of the calf found the boy, he wished, of course, to take him to his master; but the
boy laid himself down upon the ground and refused to stir. The man bound him to a tree,
and went home to fetch a horse, upon which he placed the boy and tied him there; he
walked after him to Jaguaribe, driving the horse on before. The boy was punished; but
a few hours after he had been flogged, he said to one of his companions, “Well, at least I
have had the honour of being attended by a <i>pagem</i>,” or page, the usual word for a groom.
This happened under a former tenant of Jaguaribe.</p>
<p class="pfc4">A short time before I left that plantation, the same boy fled with another of nearly the
same age, both of them being about fourteen years of age. They had been absent some
days, when late one evening an Indian labourer brought them both home. The children
had thrown off all cloathing, and had made bows and arrows suited to their own size, with
which they were to kill poultry, rats, &amp;c. as food. Their appearance was most laughable,
but it was distressing; it was soon known that they were found, and many of their companions
and other inhabitants of the plantation assembled to see and to laugh at these terrible
<i>negros do mato</i>, or <i>bush</i> negroes. The boys had been well treated by me, and therefore
the propensity to continue in practices which had commenced under severe usage
could be their only inducement to prefer the woods now.</p>

The <i>Investigador Portuguez</i> and the <i>Correio Braziliense</i>, two Portugueze journals published
in London, have arranged themselves on the side of justice, humanity, and sound
policy. The former of them has been translating Dr. Thorpe’s pamphlet respecting the
colony of Sierra Leone, and has given portions of it in each number. I hope the editors
will be aware of the necessity of fair play, and will next proceed to translate “The
Special Report of the Directors of the African Institution” in answer to the charges
preferred against them by Dr. Thorpe. I know no more of the matter to which either
of the pamphlets relate than what I have gathered from them, and from Mr. Macauley’s
letter to H. R. H. the Duke of Gloucester. But let there be fair play, let
each side be heard and judged. This is due to the African Institution, owing to the
until now unimpeached characters of its leading members. By so doing the editors of the
journal would prove most decidedly their sincerity in the cause of abolition.</p>

The cry against the injustice and tyranny which is said to have been exercised by
Great Britain in the employment of her naval superiority, has been removed at least on
this score; for a sum of money was agreed to be paid by Great Britain to the government
of Brazil for the purpose of reimbursing those of its subjects whom it might judge to have
been unjustly treated.</p>
<p class="pfc4">The captures, of which complaint was principally made, were effected under the impression
that all ships which bore the Portugueze flag, trading to the coast of Africa for slaves,
ought to be of Portugueze build. This was a mistake arising from misunderstanding the
treaties which were concluded between the two Powers in 1810.</p>

I met with the following passage in a work of high and deserved reputation. “The
Romans, notwithstanding their prodigious losses in the incessant wars which they carried
on for centuries, never experienced any want of men in the early periods of the commonwealth;
but were even able to send colonies abroad out of their redundant population.
Afterwards, in the time of the Emperors, when the armies were generally kept in camps
and garrisons, where a soldier is perhaps the healthiest of all professions, the Roman
population in Italy had greatly diminished, and was visibly declining every day, owing to
a change in the division of property, and to the pernicious and monstrous increase of
domestic slavery, which had left the poorer class of free citizens without any means of
subsistence, but public charity.”&mdash;Essay on the Military Policy and Institutions of the
British Empire, by C. W. Pasley, Captain (now Colonel) in the corps of Royal Engineers.
Note to p. 505.</p>
<p class="pfc4">In the work in which the note appears, it is introduced for the purpose of proving,
that “the total average population in any country can never be affected by the annual
number of deaths, but depends solely and exclusively upon the means of subsistence
afforded to the living.” I have transcribed it inasmuch as the author of it states,
that domestic slavery was one of the causes of the decrease of population in Italy; and
though the pernicious effects of slavery do not act to the same extent in Brazil, it does
undoubtedly prevent the rapid increase of the numbers of the people of colour; and if
the trade in Africans continues much longer, it will tend to stop the increase altogether
of the persons of mixed blood. That the increase of the free population of colour ought
to be encouraged, no one will deny; they are the pillars of the state, the bulwark from
the strength of which Brazil becomes invincible.</p>

These arguments savour somewhat of peevishness; let these plain questions be asked.
Does Great Britain interfere in the police of Brazil? Would Great Britain take the
trouble of negotiating respecting any regulations which Brazil might enact for the better
preserving of internal good order, and for providing with more ease for the apprehension
of improper persons? The truth is that Brazil does not require any thing of the kind, and
Great Britain does, consequently each Power acts according to its situation.</p>

The privileges which British subjects have long enjoyed in the dominions of the crown
of Portugal are considerable. I give as concise an account of them as I possibly can.
“D. Joam by the grace of God Prince Regent of Portugal, &amp;c. To all my <i>Corregedores</i>,
&amp;c. be it known, that Joam Bevan declares himself to be a merchant, resident in this city
(Lisbon, I suppose,) and a subject of his Britannic Majesty, and therefore competent to
enjoy all the privileges and immunities which have been conceded to British subjects, &amp;c.
The merchants of that nation may freely trade, contract, buy and sell in all these kingdoms
and lordships, &amp;c. and where a doubt arises concerning any business with them,
this shall be construed rather with a bias in their favour than against them<sup>(1)</sup>. British
subjects can only be arrested and confined in their own houses, according to their rank
in life, or in the castle of St. Jorge; and these arrests cannot be carried into executions
by bailiffs (<i>homems de vara</i>) but only by the <i>alcaide</i><sup>(2)</sup>. They are exempted from the payment
of certain duties upon those articles which they can prove to be for the use of their
own families. They cannot be obliged to give up their houses or warehouses against their
consent<sup>(3)</sup>. They cannot be obliged to serve as guardians, and they are exempted from
certain imposts. They may carry offensive and defensive arms, by day and by night with
or without a light, taking care not to do with them what they ought not to do.”</p>
<p class="pfc4">Then follow the penalties to which those officers will be subjected who do not pay a due
regard to these privileges.</p>
<p class="pfc4">The clerks and servants of Englishmen enjoy the same privileges to the number of six,
provided they are not Spaniards.</p>
<p class="pfc4">British subjects cannot be arrested, nor can their houses be searched without an order from
their judge-conservator. Then follow some regulations by which their law proceedings
may be rendered as easy as possible. They are not subject to the jurisdiction of the
<i>Juiz de Orfaons &amp; Auzentes</i><sup>(4)</sup>.</p>
<p class="pfc4">The copy of the privileges from which the above has been extracted is passed in the
name of John Bevan. I obtained it at Pernambuco as a curiosity. If the state of government
in Brazil is considered, these privileges are absolutely necessary for the prevention of
oppression; and even the privilege of wearing arms is not more than is requisite, because
although the laws which prohibit Portugueze subjects from carrying arms ordain severe
penalties, still scarcely any man in Brazil leaves his own home without some species
of weapon; and the crime which is committed in so doing is too general to be punished.</p>
<p class="pffn p1"><sup>(1)</sup> <i>Mais em seu favor do que em odio.</i>&mdash;What occasion is there for this? Impartiality is what is required.</p>
<p class="pffn"><sup>(2)</sup> An officer of a rank somewhat superior.</p>
<p class="pffn"><sup>(3)</sup> An officer of government can turn an unprivileged man out of his house by placing the letters P. R. upon his door.</p>
<p class="pffn"><sup>(4)</sup> The officer into whose hands the property of orphans falls, and of those persons who die without heirs resident upon the
spot. It is difficult to reclaim what has found its way into this office.</p>

one time, that he was obliged to root them up for the purpose of preventing their farther extension.”&mdash;Voyage

füeilles l’on en tire du fil dont l’on se sert en plusieurs endroits de l’Amerique, non seulement à faire
des toilles, mais encore à faire des licts pendans. La racine et les füeilles de cette plante broyées et
lavées dans une riviere, jettent un suc qui estourdit si fort le poisson, qu’il se laisse prendre à la main:

At Pillar, upon the island of Itamaraca, the persons who are in the habit of preparing the
<i>cairo</i>, dig holes in the sands below high water mark, and bury the rind of the coco for several
days before they beat it. I suppose this method is resorted to, owing to the want of a running
stream in which to steep the rind.&mdash;<i>Transl.</i></p>

I think Dr. Arruda may perhaps have been rather hasty in ranking it with the <i>tucum</i>, in the difficulty
of obtaining it. At Itapissuma, near to Itamaraca, a great quantity of thread is manufactured
for fishing-nets, &amp;c. and it has at that place a fixed price.&mdash;<i>Transl.</i></p>

a species of hemp, manufactured from the leaves of a particular kind of palm which abounds
in Sierra Leone and its neighbourhood, the directors have now to add, that one of their Board,
Mr. Allen, has lately subjected a small quantity of cord, manufactured from this substance,
to experiments calculated to ascertain its strength, as compared with the same length and weight
of common hempen cord. The result has been very satisfactory.” In five trials, the average is
as follows “hempen cord 43<i>lbs.</i> 3-fifths. African cord 53<i>lbs.</i> 2-fifths, being a difference in

Excepting in times of famine, the food which may be thus obtained causes too much
destruction to allow of its becoming general, and even if it should for a time afford subsistence
to the people, this cannot last long, for the trees will soon be destroyed. The quantity of food
which each tree yields is too small, the growth of the trees too slow, and the space which each
plant occupies too considerable ever to render the cabbage of the palms a permanent staple food
of any country.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Dr. Arruda has not spoken of the <i>dendezeiro</i> or <i>dende</i> tree, which, next to the coco tree, is the
palm which is of the most service to the Pernambucans. An oil of good quality is made from the

The fruit resembles much that of the <i>coco naia</i>, according to Arruda’s description of the
latter.</p>

à la Martinique, qui rapportoit du fruit quoiqu’il fut tout seul. Qu’il fut mâle ou femelle, je n’en
sçai rien, mais ce que je sçai trés certainement, c’est que dans le terrain où est le Fort Saint Pierre et

In the Philosophical Transactions for 1811 is given, “An Account of a Vegetable Wax from
Brazil,” by William Thomas Brande, Esq. F. R. S. The work from which I extract part of the
account is Nicholson’s Journal, Vol. xxxi. p. 14.</p>
<p class="pfc4">“The vegetable wax described in this paper was given to the president by Lord Grenville,
with a wish on the part of his Lordship, that its properties should be investigated, in the hope
that it might prove a useful substitute for bees’ wax, and constitute in due time a new article of
commerce between Brazil and this country. It was transmitted to Lord Grenville from Rio de
Janeiro by the Conde das Galveas<sup>(1)</sup>, as a new article lately brought to that city<sup>(2)</sup>, from the
northernmost parts of the Brazilian dominions, the <i>capitanias</i> of Rio Grande and Seará, between
the latitude of three and seven degrees north; it is said to be the production of a tree of slow
growth, called by the natives <i>carnâùba</i>, which also produces a gum used as food for men, and another
substance employed for fattening poultry.”</p>
<p class="pfc4">“The wax in its rough state is in the form of a coarse pale grey powder, soft to the touch, and
mixed with various impurities, consisting chiefly of fibres of the bark of the tree, which when
separated by a sieve amount to about 40 <i>per cent.</i> It has an agreeable odour, somewhat resembling
new hay, but scarcely any taste.”</p>
<p class="pfcc p1">(<i>Here follow various chemical Experiments which I wish I could insert, but they are too long.</i>)</p>
<p class="pfc4 p1">“Having been unsuccessful in my attempts to bleach the wax in its original state, I made
some experiments to ascertain whether its colour could be more easily destroyed, after it had
been acted upon by nitric acid, and found that by exposing it spread upon glass to the action of
light, it became in the course of three weeks of a pale straw colour, and on the surface nearly
white<sup>(3)</sup>. The same change was produced by steeping the wax, in thin plates, in an aqueous
solution of oxymuriatic gas, but I have not hitherto succeeded in rendering it perfectly white.”</p>
<p class="pfcc p1">(<i>Other chemical Experiments follow, which are of considerable Length.</i>)</p>
<p class="pfc4 p1">“From the preceding detail of experiments, it appears that although the South American
vegetable wax possesses the characteristic properties of bees’ wax, it differs from that substance
in many of its chemical habitudes; it also differs from the other varieties of wax, namely, the wax
of the myrica cerifera, of lac, and of white lac. The attempts which have been made to bleach
the wax have been conducted on a small scale; but from the experiments related, it appears
that after the colour has been changed by the action of very dilute nitric acid, it may be rendered
nearly white by the usual means. I have not had sufficient time to ascertain whether the wax
can be more effectually bleached by long continued exposure, nor have I had an opportunity of
submitting it to the processes employed by the bleachers of bees’ wax.”</p>
<p class="pfc4">“Perhaps the most important part of the present inquiry is that which relates to the combustion
of the vegetable wax, in the form of candles. The trials which have been made to ascertain its
fitness for this purpose are extremely satisfactory; and when the wick is properly proportioned
to the size of the candle, the combustion is as perfect and uniform as that of common bees’ wax.
The addition of one eighth to one tenth part of tallow is sufficient to obviate the brittleness of the
wax in its pure state, without giving it any unpleasant smell, or materially impairing the brilliancy
of its flame. A mixture of three parts of the vegetable wax with one part of bees’ wax,
also makes very excellent candles.”</p>
<p class="pffn p1"><sup>(1)</sup> This nobleman is since dead.</p>
<p class="pffn"><sup>(2)</sup> It was sent to Rio de Janeiro by Francisco de Paula Cavalcante de Albuquerque, Governor of Rio Grande do Norte.</p>
<p class="pffn"><sup>(3)</sup> The portion which the Governor of Rio Grande gave to me was in the form of a cake, which could not be pierced, but
was brittle; it was of a pale straw colour.&mdash;<i>Transl.</i></p>
